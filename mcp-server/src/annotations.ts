/**
 * MCP tool annotations for every registered tool.
 *
 * These are advisory hints for MCP clients (Codex uses them for approval
 * heuristics; Claude Code mostly ignores them). They are NOT a permission
 * boundary: per the MCP spec, clients must not treat them as trusted.
 *
 * Classification rules:
 * - readOnlyHint: the tool cannot change editor, project, or disk state.
 * - destructiveHint: the tool can remove or overwrite existing state in a
 *   way a plain undo may not recover (deletes, restores, arbitrary code,
 *   config changes, log erasure). Only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false;
 *   the spec DEFAULTS this to true, so mutating-but-additive tools must set
 *   it false explicitly.
 * - idempotentHint: calling twice with the same args has no additional
 *   effect beyond the first call.
 * - openWorldHint: whether the tool reaches outside the local editor and
 *   project. Everything here talks to the local UE4 instance or local disk,
 *   so this is false across the board (spec default is true).
 *
 * This map is intentionally central so a reviewer can audit the whole
 * read-only vs mutating vs destructive surface in one file. index.ts warns
 * at startup about any registered tool missing from this map; keep it in
 * sync when adding tools (step 6.5 of the Adding a New Tool checklist).

/**
 * Routing-policy tests: the sequencing rules, and proof the checker catches
 * what it claims to.
 *
 * Every fixture is a transcript of tool calls a session could plausibly make
 * for a representative request. Half are safe and must produce no violation;
 * half break exactly one rule and must produce exactly that one. Testing both
 * directions is the point: a checker that flags everything is as useless as one
 * that flags nothing, and only the negative fixtures can tell them apart.
 *
 * No model runs here. These assert the rules, so that a model-in-the-loop
 * harness has something to assert AGAINST later.

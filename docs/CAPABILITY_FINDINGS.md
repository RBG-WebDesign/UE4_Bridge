# Capability findings

Live probe results against the UE427PuerTSMCP editor. Each entry states what
was observed, with the reproduction. Phase P of docs/MASTERY_PLAN_2026-07-31.md
maintains this file; Phase L consumes it.

## Working

| Capability | Evidence (2026-07-31) |
|---|---|
| Object-reference reads | `read_property PlayerStart RootComponent` returns the component path string |
| Enum reads | CORRECTED 2026-08-07: reads the entry NAME, not a number. Live against `PointLight_1.LightComponent0`, `Mobility` returned `"Stationary"`; `set_property` took `"Movable"` and read back `"Movable"`. The engine does this, not the bridge: `FJsonObjectConverter` writes an enum as its name and parses one back (`JsonObjectConverter.cpp` lines 43-57 and 397-430), covering both `FEnumProperty` and enum-backed numerics. The original "returns 0, enhancement candidate" reading was never reproduced and the rows for component templates, physics and member variables below already contradicted it with `"Movable"` read-backs. A `value_name` enrichment was built against the old reading and deleted unused |
| Empty array reads | `Tags` returns `[]` |
| Blueprint class spawn | `spawn_actor` with `/Game/MCPAcceptance/BP_TestActor.BP_TestActor_C` spawned and transacted, 12.3 ms |
| call_function with qualified names | `Actor.SetActorLabel ["ProbeRenamed"]` succeeded; `Actor.GetActorLocation` returns a proper `{x,y,z}` |
| Scalar property writes | `LightComponent0.Intensity` 5000 to 50000 and back via undo, verified by read-back |
| Targeted undo | `puerts_undo` with a transaction id reverted exactly that transaction |
| Full lifecycle | spawn, screenshot, modify, undo, delete, verify-gone exercised end to end |
| Struct reads | `read_property object_path .../PlayerStart.CollisionCapsule RelativeLocation` returns `{"x":0,"y":0,"z":112.00068664550781}`; `RelativeRotation` returns `{"pitch":0,"yaw":0,"roll":0}` (2026-08-01, Phase L) |
| Struct writes | `set_property` the same target to `{"x":10,"y":20,"z":112}` returned success with the reflection read-back `{"x":10,"y":20,"z":112}`; `puerts_undo` on its transaction restored `{"x":0,"y":0,"z":112.00068664550781}` (2026-08-01) |
| Array writes and non-empty array reads | `set_property actor PlayerStart Tags ["probe_a","probe_b"]` succeeded, read back `["probe_a","probe_b"]`, undo restored `[]` (2026-08-01) |
| Arbitrary struct writes | `set_property LightComponent0.LightColor {"r":20,"g":40,"b":60,"a":255}` succeeded and read back, proving the write path is no longer limited to the three hand-coded vector and rotator cases (2026-08-01) |
| Native Blueprint authoring | `puerts_blueprint_build` created `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDoor` (parent Actor, one StaticMeshComponent, BeginPlay to PrintString) in 91 ms: `compile_status "UpToDate"`, zero errors, saved to `Content/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDoor.uasset`. `spawn_actor /Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDoor.BP_ProbeDoor_C` then spawned it. Screenshot `Saved/Screenshots/MCPBridge/phase-l3-bp-probedoor.png` (2026-08-01, Phase L) |
| Blueprint build idempotency | The identical spec rerun answered `created false`, component `created false`, one asset in `/Game/MCPGenerated` afterwards, still `UpToDate` (2026-08-01) |
| Blueprint build validate-before-mutate | Six rejected specs against the unused path `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeNative` (duplicate node id, connection to an unknown node id, missing component class, component class that is not an ActorComponent, parent class that is not an Actor, `attach_to` naming nothing): each returned `success false` with the exact reason, and `find_assets` for that name returned `count 0`, so no half-built asset was left (2026-08-01) |
| Component hierarchies | A components-only build (no graph) created `BP_ProbeNative` with `PointLightComponent Glow` attached to `SceneComponent Pivot`, compiled `UpToDate` (2026-08-01) |
| Component template properties | `puerts_blueprint_build` components take a `properties` object applied to the SCS template. `BP_ProbeDoor` rebuilt with `DoorMesh` = `StaticMesh /Engine/BasicShapes/Cube.Cube`, `OverrideMaterials ["/Engine/BasicShapes/BasicShapeMaterial.BasicShapeMaterial"]`, `RelativeScale3D {2,2,2}`, `Mobility "Movable"`, and `SkyPanel` = the same cube with `OverrideMaterials ["/Game/MCPGenerated/M_NativeAuroraSky.M_NativeAuroraSky"]`: 7 properties applied, `compile_status "UpToDate"`, saved, 177 ms. Read back off the spawned instance: `StaticMesh'/Engine/BasicShapes/Cube.Cube'`, `["Material'/Engine/BasicShapes/BasicShapeMaterial.BasicShapeMaterial'"]`, `"Movable"` (2026-08-01, Phase F1) |
| Game-asset references from a generated Blueprint | The `SkyPanel` material above is `/Game/MCPGenerated/M_NativeAuroraSky`, a Game asset an earlier native run authored, so the reference path is not limited to `/Engine` content: `read_property SkyPanel OverrideMaterials` returns `["Material'/Game/MCPGenerated/M_NativeAuroraSky.M_NativeAuroraSky'"]` (2026-08-01) |
| Phase F1 visible content | Spawned `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDoor.BP_ProbeDoor_C` and captured `Saved/Screenshots/MCPBridge/phase-f1-component-properties.png` (2085x1138). The frame shows a large light-grey cube with the engine basic-shape material standing on the dark checkered floor with its own cast shadow, and a smaller cube beside it rendering the aurora material as magenta and cyan waves on dark violet, both inside the orange selection outline. Solid shaded geometry, not the bare gizmo of the Phase L run (2026-08-01) |
| Property convergence on rerun | An identical rerun answered `created false` for the asset and both components with the same seven properties applied, `find_assets /Game/MCPGenerated` still `count 3`, `find_actors BP_ProbeDoor` still `count 1`. A rerun with changed values (mesh `Cylinder`, material `WorldGridMaterial`, scale z 3) applied them: a freshly spawned instance read back `StaticMesh'/Engine/BasicShapes/Cylinder.Cylinder'`, `WorldGridMaterial`, `z 3`, evidenced side by side in `Saved/Screenshots/MCPBridge/phase-f1-convergence.png` (2026-08-01) |
| JSON-authored gameplay runs in PIE | `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeTrigger` (SceneComponent root, StaticMeshComponent pedestal, BoxComponent trigger volume, graph BeginPlay/ActorBeginOverlap/ActorEndOverlap each to a PrintString) and `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDropper` (one physics-simulating StaticMeshComponent) were built from JSON in 127 ms and 114 ms, both `compile_status "UpToDate"`, zero errors, saved. Spawned, then `puerts_pie_start`: the captured log holds `[LogBlueprintUserMessages] [BP_ProbeTrigger_C_4] MCP_TRIGGER_ALIVE F2-2026-08-01`, `[BP_ProbeDropper_C_2] MCP_DROPPER_ALIVE`, `[PIE] Play in editor total start time 0.145 seconds`, then `MCP_OVERLAP_ENTER`, `MCP_OVERLAP_EXIT`, `MCP_OVERLAP_ENTER`, `MCP_OVERLAP_EXIT` as the dropped rigid body fell through the volume and bounced on the pedestal. Nothing but JSON specs and spawns produced any of it (2026-08-01, Phase F2) |
| Overlap events from a generated Blueprint | `ActorBeginOverlap` and `ActorEndOverlap` build as `ReceiveActorBeginOverlap`/`ReceiveActorEndOverlap` override events and fire at runtime. Both directions observed in three separate PIE sessions (2026-08-01) |
| BoxComponent trigger volume from JSON | `{"class":"BoxComponent","name":"TriggerVolume","properties":{"BoxExtent":{"x":150,"y":150,"z":150}}}` needs no collision configuration: `UShapeComponent`'s constructor sets `OverlapAllDynamic`, and a spawned instance reads back `collisionProfileName "OverlapAllDynamic"`, `collisionEnabled "QueryOnly"`, `objectType "ECC_WorldDynamic"`, `ECR_Overlap` on all eight channels, `bGenerateOverlapEvents true`, `BoxExtent {150,150,150}` (2026-08-01) |
| Collision profile from JSON, on any primitive | `"BodyInstance": {"CollisionProfileName": "OverlapAllDynamic"}` on a `StaticMeshComponent` template applies the whole profile, not just the name: the same component read back `collisionEnabled "QueryOnly"` and `ECR_Overlap` on all eight channels, having been `BlockAllDynamic`/`QueryAndPhysics` before. `FCollisionResponse::ResponseToChannels` is `UPROPERTY(transient)`, so the responses are not written by the JSON; the Blueprint recompile round-trips the template through an archive and `UPrimitiveComponent::Serialize` calls `FBodyInstance::FixupData` -> `LoadProfileData`, which fills them in from the profile name. Proven live: with the BoxComponent moved out of the trajectory, the StaticMeshComponent alone produced `MCP_OVERLAP_ENTER` and `MCP_OVERLAP_EXIT` in PIE (2026-08-01) |
| Physics from JSON | `"BodyInstance": {"bSimulatePhysics": true}` plus `"Mobility": "Movable"` on a generated component gives a simulating rigid body: read back `bSimulatePhysics true`, `bEnableGravity true`, `Mobility "Movable"`, and in PIE the actor fell and came to rest (2026-08-01) |
| Private UPROPERTY reads and writes | `bGenerateOverlapEvents` is private on `UPrimitiveComponent` with Blueprint getter/setter. Both `read_property` and a `blueprint_build` component property reach it by name; the level's `Floor` read back `false`, a generated component read back `true` (2026-08-01) |
| PIE round trip | `pie_start` -> `get_logs` -> `pie_stop`, four times in one session, no editor restart. Editor-side calls after each stop behaved normally; `puerts_diagnostic` reported 12 actors and `is_game_thread true` afterwards (2026-08-01) |
| Blueprint member variables from JSON | `puerts_blueprint_build` takes `variables: [{name, type, default?, container?, category?}]`. `BP_ProbeDoorV2` carries `bIsOpen:bool = false`; `BP_ProbeNative` carries a nine-variable type sweep. Read back off a freshly spawned instance: `StaminaMax` 100, `OpenCount` 3, `DoorName` `"MCP door"`, `OpenOffset` `{0,0,400}`, `OpenRotation` `{pitch 0, yaw 90, roll 0}`, `PanelMesh` `StaticMesh'/Engine/BasicShapes/Cube.Cube'`, `SpawnClass` `BlueprintGeneratedClass'/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDropper.BP_ProbeDropper_C'`, `Waypoints` `[]`, `PanelMobility` `"Movable"`. Types: bool, byte, int, int64, float, string, name, text, vector, vector2d, rotator, transform, linearcolor, `object:<class>`, `class:<class>`, `struct:<path>`, `enum:<path>`, each with `container` none/array/set (2026-08-02, mutator re-front) |
| Variable convergence and conflict rejection | An identical rerun answers `created false` per variable with the default reapplied, `compile_status "UpToDate"`. A rerun asking for `bIsOpen` as `float` is refused: `Variable 'bIsOpen' already exists as bool; the spec asks for float. Retyping is not done implicitly: it would drop every graph node that reads it.` (2026-08-02) |
| Variable validate-before-mutate | Six rejected specs against the unused path `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeRejectV2` (unknown type `boolean`, bool default given as the string `"yes"`, vector default with the misspelled field `zz`, a default on an array variable, an object default whose asset does not load, plus an unknown `Operator` op): each named the variable and the reason, and `find_assets` for that name returned `count 0` afterwards (2026-08-02) |
| Graph node vocabulary, 26 types | `GetSupportedNodeTypes` returns BeginPlay, Tick, ActorBeginOverlap, ActorEndOverlap, PrintString, CallFunction, Operator, Delay, Branch, Sequence, Comment, Event, CustomEvent, VariableGet, VariableSet, Cast, Select, Knot, MakeStruct, BreakStruct, FormatText, SpawnActor, SwitchInt, SwitchString, MultiGate, DoOnceMultiInput. All 26 built live: 25 in one graph on `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeNative` (25 nodes, 14 connections, zero unresolved pins, `compile_status "UpToDate"`, saved) and ActorBeginOverlap in the door graph (2026-08-02) |
| Named operators | The `Operator` node type takes `params.op` from a gated table of 25 verified UKismetMathLibrary and UKismetStringLibrary calls: not_bool, and_bool, or_bool, add/subtract/multiply/divide_float, greater/less/greater_equal/less_equal/equal_float, clamp_float, lerp_float, add/subtract/greater/less/equal_int, make_vector, add_vector, multiply_vector_float, append_string, vector_to_string, bool_to_string. An unknown name is rejected with the full list before the asset is touched (2026-08-02) |
| Latent Delay in a generated event graph | `{"type":"Delay","params":{"Duration":1.0}}` builds as a `UK2Node_CallFunction` on `UKismetSystemLibrary::Delay` and runs: in PIE the door's before and after markers are separated by the delay and both fire (2026-08-02) |
| A door that physically moves, from JSON alone | `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDoorV2`: SceneComponent root, Pedestal and DoorPanel StaticMeshComponents, a BoxComponent trigger with `BodyInstance.CollisionProfileName "OverlapAllDynamic"`, the variable `bIsOpen`, and a 19-node graph (ActorBeginOverlap -> VariableGet -> Operator not_bool -> Branch -> VariableSet true -> PrintString -> SceneComponent.K2_SetRelativeLocation -> Delay 1.0 s -> PrintString). PIE, with the F2 physics dropper as the triggering body: `[BP_ProbeDoorV2_C_0] MCP_DOOR_OPENING panel=X=950.000 Y=0.000 Z=220.000` then `[BP_ProbeDoorV2_C_0] MCP_DOOR_OPENED panel=X=950.000 Y=0.000 Z=620.000`. The panel's own `K2_GetComponentLocation` reports it 400 uu higher after the move, so the motion is measured by the graph rather than asserted. Exactly one opening per run: the second overlap pass that F2 recorded is swallowed by the `bIsOpen` guard, which is the variable doing its job (2026-08-02, Phase F3) |
| Sound from a generated graph, proven by playing state | `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDoorV3` is the door plus five sound nodes: `CallFunction GameplayStatics.SpawnSoundAtLocation` with `Sound` as the pin default `/Engine/EditorSounds/Notifications/CompileSuccess.CompileSuccess`, then `KismetSystemLibrary.IsValid` on the returned AudioComponent, a Branch, and `AudioComponent.IsPlaying` reported through `bool_to_string`. In PIE: `[BP_ProbeDoorV3_C_1] MCP_DOOR_SOUND spawned=1 playing=true`, and after the door's 1 s Delay `MCP_DOOR_SOUND after_1s component_valid=false` - the `bAutoDestroy` component is gone because the sound finished, so the log records a whole playback lifecycle rather than a void call that returned. The same PIE session logs `[LogAudio] Creating Audio Device: Id: 3`, `[LogAudioMixer] Using Audio Device Speakers (High Definition Audio Device)`, `Output buffers initialized: Frames=1024, Channels=2, Samples=2048`, so the mixer was real hardware. **Audible is not provable from here**; playing-state plus completion is the honest bar (2026-08-02, Phase F3) |
| An engine SoundWave as a graph pin default | `find_assets type SoundWave path /Engine recursive` returns 50: the editor notification cues (`CompileSuccess`, `CompileFailed`), the GamePreview set, `/Engine/EngineSounds/WhiteNoise`, and the VREditor UI bank. `ApplyPinDefault` loads an object pin's default with `LoadObject`, so the asset path string is all a `Sound` pin needs (2026-08-02) |
| Native Widget Blueprint authoring | `puerts_widget_build` created `/Game/MCPGenerated/WBP_ProbeHUD` (CanvasPanel root, TextBlock `Title`, ProgressBar `StaminaBar`, TextBlock `Readout`, each with a positioned canvas slot) in 102 ms: `widget_count 4`, `compile_status "UpToDate"`, saved to `Content/MCPGenerated/WBP_ProbeHUD.uasset`, `generated_class_path /Game/MCPGenerated/WBP_ProbeHUD.WBP_ProbeHUD_C`. Read back off the widget templates by object path: `WidgetTree.StaminaBar Percent` -> `0.41999998688697815`, `FillColorAndOpacity` -> `{r 0.1, g 0.8, b 0.4, a 1}`, `WidgetTree.Title Text` -> `"MCP_HUD_TITLE"`, `WidgetTree.Readout Justification` -> `"Right"` (2026-08-02, Phase F3) |
| Widget build convergence | The identical spec rerun answered `created false`, `Widget Blueprint updated.`, `widget_count 4`, still `UpToDate`, saved. A nested tree (CanvasPanel -> VerticalBox -> Border -> Button -> TextBlock, `widget_count 6`) built clean in one pass, so panel, content and leaf categories all attach (2026-08-02) |
| Widget tree read-back | The `tree` in the response is walked from the built `UWidgetTree`, not echoed from the request: each node reports `name`, `class`, its `slot` class, and for a `CanvasPanelSlot` the position, size and z-order taken from `LayoutData.Offsets`. `Title` read back `position {60,40} size {480,48} z_order 2`, which is the slot applier's work rather than the caller's (2026-08-02) |
| Widget build validate-before-mutate | Eight rejected specs against the unused path `/Game/MCPGenerated/WBP_ProbeReject2`, each naming the node path: `R.T: Unsupported property 'percent' on TextBlock`, `R.P: Property 'percent' has wrong type`, `R.Same: Duplicate widget name 'Same'`, `R.T: Leaf widget 'TextBlock' cannot have children`, `R.B: Content widget 'Button' can have at most 1 child, got 2`, `Root widget must be a Panel type, got 'TextBlock'`, `Unknown top-level key 'theme'`, plus an unknown slot key and a missing `tree` refused by the client schema. `find_assets` for that name returned `count 0` afterwards (2026-08-02) |
| A JSON-authored HUD on screen in PIE | `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeHUDHost` carries a `class:UserWidget` variable defaulted to `WBP_ProbeHUD_C` and a 22-node BeginPlay graph: `WidgetBlueprintLibrary.Create` -> `IsValid` -> Branch -> `UserWidget.AddToViewport` -> `IsInViewport` printed, then Delay 1 s and `IsInViewport` again, then `UserWidget.GetCachedGeometry` -> `SlateBlueprintLibrary.GetLocalSize` -> `Conv_Vector2dToString` printed. In PIE: `MCP_HUD created=1 in_viewport=true`, `MCP_HUD after_1s in_viewport=true`, `MCP_HUD painted_size=X=1480.908 Y=1080.192`. The cached geometry is Slate's own arranged size for the root canvas, so the widget was laid out and painted at PIE viewport size rather than merely registered (2026-08-02, Phase F3) |
| Phase F3 complete in one PIE session | One `pie_start` produced, in order: `[BP_ProbeDropper_C_1] MCP_DROPPER_ALIVE`, `[BP_ProbeHUDHost_C_1] MCP_HUD created=1 in_viewport=true`, `[PIE] Play in editor total start time 0.15 seconds.`, `MCP_HUD after_1s in_viewport=true`, `MCP_HUD painted_size=X=1480.908 Y=1080.192`, `[BP_ProbeDoorV3_C_1] MCP_DOOR_OPENING panel=X=950.000 Y=0.000 Z=220.000`, `MCP_DOOR_SOUND spawned=1 playing=true`, `MCP_DOOR_OPENED panel=X=950.000 Y=0.000 Z=620.000`, `MCP_DOOR_SOUND after_1s component_valid=false`. Trigger volume, moving door, sound and HUD, all from JSON specs and three spawns, with no `Accessed None` and no Blueprint runtime error in the window. Screenshot `Saved/Screenshots/MCPBridge/phase-f3-door-sound-hud.png` (2026-08-02) |
| Unresolved graph connections fail the build | Limitation 20 closed. `blueprint_build` against the unused path `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeConn` with `start.exec -> isv.exec` and `isv.exec -> say.exec` wired against the pure `KismetSystemLibrary.IsValid` answered `success false`, `saved false`, `graph.connection_count 1`, `connections_requested 3`, `unresolved_connections ["start.exec -> isv.exec (no input pin 'exec' on isv)", "isv.exec -> say.exec (no output pin 'exec' on isv)"]`, and one `errors[]` entry naming both pairs. The same spec with the exec chain corrected answered `success true`, `connection_count 2 of 2`, saved. The old behaviour was `compile_status "UpToDate"`, `errors []`, `saved true` (2026-08-02, Phase F4) |
| The `InputKey` node type | `UK2Node_InputKey` binds a literal `FKey` (`K2Node_InputKey.h:28`) and needs no axis or action mapping in `DefaultInput.ini`, which is why it is the one input factory now advertised. `{"type":"InputKey","params":{"fkey_name":"LeftShift"}}` builds with pins `Pressed`, `Released`, `Key` (`K2Node_InputKey.cpp:56-59`), both exec outputs wired to PrintStrings, `compile_status "UpToDate"`. An unknown key name is refused by the factory, and because the node then spawns nothing the connection that referenced it is reported: `key.Pressed -> down.exec (node 'key' spawned no node)` (2026-08-02, Phase F4) |
| A Character subclass from JSON, possessing itself | `puerts_blueprint_build` with `parent_class "Character"` builds `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_StaminaCharacter`: 22 variables, one StaticMeshComponent, a 198-node / 246-connection graph, `compile_status "UpToDate"`, saved, 16 assets before and after a rerun. In PIE it takes control of itself with `GameplayStatics.GetPlayerController(0)` -> `Controller.Possess`, and reports `MCP_STAM_POSSESS player_controlled=true` (2026-08-02, Phase F4) |
| CharacterMovement speed at runtime | `Pawn.GetMovementComponent` (pure) into `KismetSystemLibrary.SetFloatPropertyByName(Object, PropertyName "MaxWalkSpeed", Value)`, read back through `MovementComponent.GetMaxSpeed` (pure). In PIE the log carries `maxWalkSpeed=420.0` while walking and `maxWalkSpeed=900.0` while sprinting, and the pawn's own `GetVelocity` length agrees: `speed=420.000305` and `speed=900.000122`. `BlueprintInternalUseOnly` on the setter does not block it (limitation 22) (2026-08-02, Phase F4) |
| CustomEvents called from the same graph, by a two-pass build | A `CallFunction` whose class is the Blueprint's own generated class cannot resolve on the build that creates it, because the class does not exist yet. Pass 1 declares the CustomEvents and compiles; pass 2 wires `CallFunction {class: "/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_StaminaCharacter.BP_StaminaCharacter_C", function: "MCP_ANIM_SPRINT_START"}` against the class pass 1 generated. Both passes converge on rerun. In PIE the placeholders fire on every sprint edge with their own timestamps (2026-08-02, Phase F4) |
| A HUD widget driven every tick | `UWidget::SetRenderOpacity` and `SetRenderScale` are BlueprintCallable on `UUserWidget` itself, and `GetRenderOpacity` is a pure read of the same value. The host sets opacity and X scale to `CurrentStamina / MaxStamina` each tick and reports the widget's own answer: `hudPercent=1.0`, `0.751908`, `0.256035`, `0.0`, `0.181571`, tracking `stamina=100.0`, `75.190781`, `25.603493`, `0.0`, `18.15708`. The reported number is read back off the widget, not the variable that was written (2026-08-02, Phase F4) |
| The stamina feature end to end in PIE | One session, all from JSON: `MCP_STAM_POSSESS player_controlled=true`, `MCP_STAM_HUD created=1 in_viewport=true`, `MCP_STAM t=1.004709 stamina=100.0 sprinting=false canSprint=true maxWalkSpeed=420.0 speed=420.000305 hudPercent=1.0`, `MCP_ANIM_SPRINT_START placeholder fired t=2.004796`, `MCP_STAM t=3.005499 stamina=75.190781 sprinting=true canSprint=true maxWalkSpeed=900.0 speed=900.000122`, `MCP_STAM_EMPTY stamina hit zero, sprint force-stopped`, `MCP_STAM t=7.005782 stamina=0.0 sprinting=false canSprint=false maxWalkSpeed=420.0`, `MCP_STAM t=8.008076 stamina=7.126184` (regen after the 1.5 s delay), `MCP_STAM_READY sprint re-allowed at stamina=30.032526`, `MCP_STAM t=10.010129 stamina=18.15708 sprinting=true maxWalkSpeed=900.0`. No `Accessed None` and no Blueprint runtime error in the window. Three PIE sessions, same behaviour (2026-08-02, Phase F4) |
| A non-Actor Blueprint from JSON | Limitation 23 closed. `blueprint_build` with `parent_class "/Script/Engine.SaveGame"` created `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_StaminaSave` (one float variable `SavedStamina`, no components, no graph): `compile_status "UpToDate"`, saved, 17 assets afterwards. `/Script/CoreUObject.Object` with a variable and a CustomEvent -> PrintString graph built as `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeDataOnly`; `/Script/Engine.ActorComponent` with a float variable built as `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeStaminaComp`. All three were unreachable before (2026-08-02, Phase L) |
| Actor-only capability is gated by parent, not by refusing the parent | Against the unused path `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeNonActor` with a SaveGame parent: a `components` array is refused with `Components need an Actor parent: /Script/Engine.SaveGame does not derive from Actor, and only an Actor Blueprint has a SimpleConstructionScript to hold them.`, and a `BeginPlay` or `InputKey` node with `Graph node 'bp' is of type 'BeginPlay', which needs an Actor parent: ... BeginPlay, Tick, ActorBeginOverlap, ActorEndOverlap and InputKey bind actor entry points.` `find_assets` for that name returned `count 0` afterwards, so the rejection is still before the asset exists (2026-08-02) |
| A Cast node that types itself | Limitation 26 closed. `UEdGraphPin::MakeLinkTo` moves pointers and stops; the graph editor's `TryCreateConnection` also calls `PinConnectionListChanged` on both ends, which is where `UK2Node_DynamicCast::NotifyPinConnectionListChanged` (`K2Node_DynamicCast.cpp:347`) types its `Object` pin from what it is wired to. The builder now sends both notifications. `Cast` to `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_StaminaSave.BP_StaminaSave_C` with `Object` from `GameplayStatics.LoadGameFromSlot` compiles `UpToDate` where the same spec used to fail with `The type of Object is undetermined.` (2026-08-02, Phase L) |
| DeterminesOutputType from a pin default | The same root cause, the other half. A pin default is now announced with `PinDefaultValueChanged`, which is where `UK2Node_CallFunction::PinDefaultValueChanged` -> `FDynamicOutputHelper::ConformOutputType` (`K2Node_CallFunction.cpp:1239`) retypes the output. `GameplayStatics.CreateSaveGameObject` carries `meta=(DeterminesOutputType="SaveGameClass")` (`GameplayStatics.h:976`) and now hands back the requested subclass instead of a bare `USaveGame*` (2026-08-02) |
| The `AsResult` cast pin role | A dynamic cast names its result pin `"As"` plus the target type's **display** name (`K2Node_DynamicCast.cpp:63`), which for a Blueprint generated class is neither the asset name nor anything a caller can compute from its own spec. The connection resolver takes the role `AsResult` and asks the node through `GetCastResultPin()`. Three connections in the F4 graph use it (2026-08-02) |
| Target-scoped variable access | `VariableGet` and `VariableSet` take `scope "target"` with `target_class`; the node's member reference becomes `SetExternalMember` and it grows a `self` input pin (`UK2Node_Variable::CreatePinForSelf`, `K2Node_Variable.cpp:112`) for the object to read or write. The F4 save path wires the cast result into `VariableSet SavedStamina` on `BP_StaminaSave_C`, and the load path reads it back with `VariableGet`. A `target_class` that names no such property is refused by the factory before the node exists (2026-08-02) |
| Cross-session save and load through generated Blueprints | **A verified SaveGame persistence path, not a complete feature pipeline.** Limitation 24 closed, which was the last unmet part of Phase F4. Two PIE sessions, one slot, one value. Session one: `MCP_SAVE_PRECHECK slot_exists_at_boot=false`, `[LogStreaming] Failed to read file '.../Saved/SaveGames/MCPStamina.sav' error.`, `MCP_LOAD found=false restored=none`, then `MCP_SAVE object_valid=true wrote=true stamina_at_save=16.133768`. On disk afterwards: `Saved/SaveGames/MCPStamina.sav`, 1325 bytes.

| Reading a Blueprint back as JSON | `puerts_graph_inspect` on `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeConn` returns `parent_class /Script/Engine.Actor`, `compile_status "UpToDate"`, one component (`DefaultSceneRoot`, `/Script/Engine.SceneComponent`, `is_root true`), two graphs (`EventGraph` Ubergraph, `UserConstructionScript` Function), and an `EventGraph` of **3 nodes and 2 connections** - the same 3 and 2 the build that made it reported. Node types come back as the builder's own words: `BeginPlay`, `CallFunction` (`{class: /Script/Engine.KismetSystemLibrary, function: IsValid}`) and `PrintString`. Connections read `K2Node_Event_6.then -> K2Node_CallFunction_7.execute` and `K2Node_CallFunction_6.ReturnValue -> K2Node_CallFunction_7.bPrintToScreen`, each also carrying both endpoint NodeGuids and PinIds (2026-08-01) |
| Inspection is deterministic, byte for byte | Two reads of `BP_ProbeConn` with `include_pins`, nothing between them: **byte-identical payloads, 14,049 bytes**, SHA-256 `eebd873da251f489d6aa82f591b38020d1d1a1121880bec7ef0685ea5613dfd2` twice, across two separate server processes. Two reads of `BP_StaminaCharacter`: byte-identical at **847,143 bytes**, SHA-256 `29f1a9239811955bb39c1c54976a75b957fb685a23ab1f32c7c6f46ffb14672c`. No exclusion list was needed. This is not luck: every array is sorted by a stable identity (nodes by NodeGuid, pins by direction then PinId, connections by their four endpoint identities, components/variables/functions/graphs by name) and no `TMap` is iterated to produce output anywhere on the path (2026-08-01) |
| The 198-node graph reads back whole | `puerts_graph_inspect` on `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_StaminaCharacter` reports **198 nodes and 252 connections**, against `reports/session-2026-08-02-stamina-save.json`'s build report of "198 nodes, 252 of 252 connections made". 783 pins, 37 variables, 1 component, `parent_class /Script/Engine.Character`. `unmapped_nodes` is empty and `lossy_pin_defaults` is empty, so every node in the hardest graph the builder has produced maps back to a builder node type. The histogram: Operator 72, CallFunction 46, VariableGet 24, VariableSet 18, Branch 13, PrintString 12, CustomEvent 4, InputKey 3, Cast 2, Sequence 2, BeginPlay 1, Tick 1 (2026-08-01) |
| Inspection does not write, and proves it | Six inspection calls in one editor session against two Blueprints. `package_dirty_before` and `package_dirty_after` were `false` on every call; `transaction_id` was `""` on every response and `changed_assets` empty. Across the whole editor log: `LogSavePackage` 0 lines, Blueprint compile 0 lines, `BuildBlueprintFromJSON` 0 lines, `MCP PuerTS: <tool>` transaction descriptions 0 lines, and 30 `LogBlueprintInspector` reader lines, which is exactly 6 calls times 5 readers and nothing else. `BP_ProbeConn.uasset`, `BP_ProbeDoor.uasset` and `BP_StaminaCharacter.uasset` all held their byte size, their mtime to the nanosecond and their SHA-256 across the run (2026-08-01) |
| Limitation 32's variable accumulation, measured | The inspector put a number on it without touching anything: `BP_StaminaCharacter` carries **37 member variables** where the current spec declares 23. The extra 14 are the previous session's set, which a rerun cannot remove because the variable pass is additive. Recorded here because it is the first time the drift has been counted rather than described (2026-08-01) |
| Property validate-before-mutate | Eight rejected specs against the unused path `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeProps`, each naming component, property, and reason: unknown property name, unloadable asset path, asset of the wrong class, wrong class inside a material array (`element 0: ... is a StaticMesh, but the property holds a MaterialInterface`), a string where an array belongs, a string where a struct belongs, and an out-of-range or misspelled enumerator (`expects a EComponentMobility enumerator: Static=0, Stationary=1, Movable=2`). `find_assets` for that name returned `count 0` afterwards (2026-08-01) |

| Independent Widget Blueprint inspection | `puerts_widget_inspect` closes the last builder/inspector asymmetry: `blueprint_build`/`graph_inspect` and `behavior_tree_build`/`behavior_tree_inspect` had one, widget did not, so its only read-back was the builder's own report. Against `/Game/MCPGenerated/WBP_AtomicityGood` (CanvasPanel root, TextBlock `Title` at position 40,24 size 320,40, ProgressBar `Bar`): payload **7044 bytes**, structure hash `4C33675FF120DB53FB2E193B4B161AF3A1AD12A2`. Read-only measured rather than asserted: `transaction_id ""`, `package_dirty_before`/`after` both false, `changed_assets` empty, and the asset's SHA-256 and mtime unchanged across the reads. Two reads produced identical canonical JSON and the same structure hash. The independent read agreed with the build's own report on widget count, root name and class, child order (`["Title","Bar"]` with `child_index` matching array order), and slot geometry read off `UCanvasPanelSlot::LayoutData` rather than echoed: offsets left 40, top 24, right 320, bottom 40, plus anchors, alignment and z-order. A rerun of the same spec produced the **same structure hash**, and after an editor restart the cold-loaded asset reproduced that hash, the same widget count, and a byte-identical file (2026-08-02) |
| Widget inspection rejects cleanly | A missing path, a `/Script/UMG` path outside the two content roots, and a Blueprint asset passed to the widget inspector each return `success false`; the wrong-class case names it (`is a Blueprint, not a WidgetBlueprint`). Identity is `derived` like the BT inspector, because UE4.27 UMG widgets carry no GUID: a widget is addressed by `parent/childIndex:Class:Name`, so a rename or reorder is deliberately a different identity. Named-slot content is walked through `INamedSlotInterface`, which panel-child traversal cannot reach (2026-08-02) |

| `remove_unlisted.variables` verification status | **live_verified as of 2026-08-02.** Promoted only after the full induced-failure proof passed, which took four sessions and two ruled-out approaches. It is a sub-capability of `puerts_blueprint_build` (already live_verified) and has no separate metadata key, so the status is recorded here rather than by inventing an entry `check:inventory` would reject. Evidence: `Scripts/bp-remove-unlisted-acceptance.mjs` warm and cold, `docs/evidence/bp-remove-unlisted-*.json`. Everything the promotion rests on: convergence downward and upward, protection by ownership stamp, blocked referenced removals, forced removal with node deletion reported, plan_only read-only, and a failing build that leaves the Blueprint byte-identical to how it found it - variables, reference nodes, untouched graph nodes, file hash and package dirty state |
| Blueprint variable downward convergence (`remove_unlisted`) | Opt-in, off by default, variables scope only. Ownership is an explicit stamp, not a heuristic: `blueprint_build` writes `MCPManaged=1` metadata on every variable it declares, and removal only ever considers stamped variables, so inherited, native C++, engine-generated and human-authored variables are protected **by construction** rather than by an exclusion list, and a Blueprint authored before this change has nothing removable until a build declares its managed set. Live on `BP_ConvergeProbe` (six managed variables, graph nodes referencing two): `plan_only` returned `variables_to_remove ["DropAlsoPlain","DropPlain"]`, `blocked_removals` naming `DropReferenced` with its reference locations, and left inspection byte-identical. An unforced apply removed exactly the two unreferenced ones and left the referenced one alive with no node deleted; `force_remove_referenced` then removed it and reported every deleted node. `graph_inspect` independently confirmed the final set is exactly `["KeptA","KeptB","KeptC"]`, that `KeptA`'s reference node survived, and that BeginPlay/PrintString were untouched. Rerun removes nothing and the inspected variable set is byte-stable; after a restart the cold-loaded asset is still converged (2026-08-02) |
| Unsupported `remove_unlisted` scopes are rejected, never ignored | `functions`, `macros`, `graph_nodes` and `interfaces` set `true` return `unsupported_scope`; `components` is now implemented by FP-4. False values and known implemented scopes are accepted. An unknown scope key is rejected. FP-4 live evidence is pending (updated 2026-08-03). |
| Defect 0 reproduced independently, on `VariableGet` | The builder's config key is `varName`; a spec using `params.variable` makes the factory return null while the build still reports `node_count 2` and `node_types ["BeginPlay","VariableGet"]`, and `graph_inspect` sees only `["BeginPlay"]`. Found while writing the `remove_unlisted` fixture: every reference assertion in it passed **vacuously** because the reference nodes did not exist. This is the same phantom-counting defect 0 records for `Cast`, now confirmed on a second node type and caught only by comparing the build's own report against the independent inspector - which is the argument for builder/inspector parity in one line (2026-08-02) |

| Truthful Blueprint build reporting | Defect 0 closed for counting. `node_count` came from `RequestedNodeTypes.Num()` and `NodeMap.Add(NodeId, SpawnedNode)` ran **even when the factory returned null**, so a refused node stayed in the count: a build reported `node_count 2` while `graph_inspect` saw one node. Now the builder reports `OutCreatedNodes`/`OutFailedNodes`, skips null nodes and nodes created in a graph other than the one requested, and the command reports `requested_node_count` / `created_node_count` / `failed_node_count` / `failed_nodes` and the connection triple, on the success **and** failure payloads. A refused node now fails the whole build: partial graph creation is not a success mode. Live: `VariableGet` with `variable` instead of `varName` returns `success false` naming the refused node and its supplied parameters, `created_node_count` excludes it, and the gate `created_node_count == independently inspected node_count` holds on the valid graph (4), the rerun (4) and MultiGate (2). `Cast` with an unresolvable target class behaves the same. No failing case left a dirty package, a file change, a source-control entry or a save prompt. `Scripts/bp-truthful-report-acceptance.mjs`, 27 of 28 checks (2026-08-02) |

## Issue A, 2026-08-05: the hash is a SYMPTOM. scene_inspect intermittently reports an empty world

Investigated on `investigate/hash-determinism`. The nondeterministic hash and
the item-4 precondition flake are **one bug**, and it is not a hashing bug.

### What is established, reproducibly

`puerts_scene_inspect` intermittently returns `success: true`, the correct
`level_path`, a valid 40-hex hash, and **zero actors** for a level holding 18.
Caught at read 21 of 80, and again at read 73 of 120 - roughly 1 in 30 to 1 in
100, with no mutation, no PIE and no user activity:

```text
NORMAL  count=18  elapsed_ms=1.40  hash=efa8557c472de323450ec7c08e63a632f0b77aaf
EMPTY   count=0   elapsed_ms=0.05  hash=00640089900a6a395e68809f63443505afd5a414
```

`00640089900a6a395e68809f63443505afd5a414` is the hash of an empty level. It is
the same value that appeared in the item-4 precondition failure, which is what
ties the two symptoms together: a plan or an apply that lands on an empty read
compares a real hash against the hash of nothing and reports `state_conflict`.

The 30x drop in `elapsed_ms` says the actor iteration reached the end
immediately rather than doing work and finding nothing.

### What has been disproved, with measurements

A `world_diagnostics` block was added to `scene_inspect` (diagnostic only,
nothing branches on it) and captured on both a normal and an empty read. The
two are **identical**:

```json
{"world_object_path":"/Game/MCPGenerated/L_BridgeThirdPerson.L_BridgeThirdPerson",
 "world_type":"2","world_initialized":true,"level_count":1,
 "current_level_null":false,"current_level_actor_array":18,
 "all_levels_actor_array":18,"play_world_active":false,
 "world_context_count":1,"gc_pending":false,
 "current_level_visible":true,"visible_level_count":1}
```

That disproves, for this failure:

- **A null, wrong, or uninitialized world.** Same world object path, initialized.
- **An empty or missing level.** One level, `Actors.Num()` is 18 at the instant
  the iterator returns none.
- **Garbage collection mid-read.** `gc_pending` false.
- **A PIE world or a second world context.** Neither present.
- **`EActorIteratorFlags::OnlyActiveLevels` skipping a level whose `bIsVisible`
  flickered.** This was the leading hypothesis and it is wrong:
  `current_level_visible` is true and `visible_level_count` is 1 on the empty
  read.
- **Float formatting, sort order, negative zero, tag order, label churn.** All
  irrelevant: the input set is empty, not differently encoded. The probe also
  found spawn, move, delete and tag phases individually STABLE across 12 reads.

Also disproved along the way: an earlier version of the probe reported the hash
unstable in 5 of 8 phases, but it did not check `success`, so a refused read
became an `undefined` hash counted as a second value. Corrected; the probe now
separates call failures from hash samples and reports them apart.

### What is still open

`TActorIterator<AActor>(World)` yields nothing while that world's only level is
visible and holds 18 valid actors. The remaining candidates are inside the
iteration itself, not around it:

- the iterator's own suitability filter rejecting every actor for one call;
- `SortedLevelActors`'s `IsValid`/`IsPendingKill` filter rejecting all 18;
- an early-return path inside `InspectSceneJson` producing an empty result that
  never reached the iterator at all.

The next diagnostic separates those three and is small: count what the iterator
visits, what each filter rejects, and which branch produced the result, and
report all three next to `actor_count`. Until that runs, no cause is claimed.

### Impact, unchanged by this investigation

It still fails closed. An empty read can only make a precondition REFUSE a valid
apply; it cannot make one accept an invalid apply, because the empty hash never
matches a real expected hash. `scene_inspect` returning an empty level to a
caller who believes it is real is the more serious half, and it is the reason
this is filed as a state-query defect rather than a hashing one.

### Artifacts

`Scripts/hash-determinism-probe.mjs` runs the phase matrix and writes
`hash-input-before/after/diff.<phase>.json` under
`<project>/Saved/MCPPuerTSBridge/hash-probe/` on the first mismatch of each
phase.

## Superseded: the scene structure hash is not stable across consecutive reads after a mutation

Found 2026-08-05 while accepting the `scene_structure_hash` precondition
(item 4). Recorded here rather than left in a test log because AGENTS.md is
explicit: a project-state query discrepancy is a tracked Unknown, and a tool
that controls Unreal must be able to trust its own state queries.

**What is observed.** `Scripts/precondition-acceptance.mjs` intermittently fails
- roughly 3 runs in 10 - in one of two places, and both are the same symptom:

```text
FAIL  9. data carries the observed hash, and it matches an independent read
      observed d69e971d9f3283506e6c162226244d45d4d27fa8,
      inspect  00640089900a6a395e68809f63443505afd5a414
FAIL  5. the level hashes the same before and after the refusal
```

The first is `scene_batch`'s own `observed` hash disagreeing with a
`scene_inspect` taken immediately around it. The second is the level hashing
differently before and after a refusal that changed nothing. Both mean
`StructureHash(World)` returned two values for a level nobody mutated in
between.

**What has been ruled out, with measurements.**

- *A settling editor.* Six `scene_inspect` reads at one-second intervals on a
  freshly started editor: one distinct hash. Stable.
- *An asynchronous navigation rebuild after a spawn.* Spawned a
  StaticMeshActor at (700, -700, 300), inside `NavMeshBoundsVolume_Main`, then
  hashed immediately and at +1s, +2s and +4s: one distinct hash throughout, and
  deleting the probe returned the level to its exact pre-spawn hash.
- *"It only fails on the first run after a restart."* Claimed, then disproved:
  a first run after a fresh restart passed, and failures have occurred on later
  runs.

**What is still open.** Both ruled-out tests only ever spawned and deleted. The
acceptance additionally MOVES an actor that sits inside the nav bounds, and no
test has yet isolated a move. The next diagnostic is to move an actor inside the
bounds, then hash repeatedly, and compare against the same loop with the actor
moved outside them - which distinguishes a navigation-driven change from one in
the moved actor's own structural key.

**Safety impact: none, and the direction matters.** The precondition fails
CLOSED. An unstable hash makes `scene_batch` occasionally REFUSE an apply that
would have been valid; it cannot make it accept one that is not. A caller sees
`state_conflict`, re-plans and proceeds. Nothing is written on the strength of a
hash that moved.

**Correctness impact on item 4's promise.** `structure_hash_sha1` is documented
as stable across two reads of an unchanged level. That is true for a level
nobody has mutated and NOT reliably true in the window after a mutation, so a
plan-apply pair around a mutation can conflict spuriously. Retries are the
workaround; a caller should not treat a single `state_conflict` as proof the
level really moved.

The acceptance now reads the hash immediately before the apply and prints it
next to the planned one, so the next occurrence states whether the level
actually changed rather than only that the apply was refused.

## Defects and limitations (Phase L queue)

0j. **RESOLVED 2026-08-02, and every hypothesis about it was wrong.** The node
   was landing in the live graph the whole time. The diagnostic that settled it
   was the ledger's own output: `reference_nodes_removed
   ["EventGraph.K2Node_VariableGet_6"]` against `reference_nodes_restored
   ["EventGraph.K2Node_VariableGet_7"]`. Graph lookup, insertion, pin
   allocation and compile all worked; the recreated node is a NEW UObject and
   gets a new name, and the verification compared **object names**. The
   restore was correct and the report called it a failure.

   A false negative in a rollback report is not harmless: it makes a working
   restore look like data loss, which is the same class of error as the false
   positive 0g was fixed to remove, pointing the other way.

   Comparison is now by structural identity - graph name, node class,
   referenced variable, node position - with object names deliberately absent
   from it. `rollback_succeeded` is true only after that comparison passes, and
   the sabotage direction still works: a node that genuinely fails to return
   produces a mismatch and a false flag.

   Worth keeping: none of the eight hypotheses in the session goal (stale graph
   pointer, EventGraph reconstruction, node not added to Graph->Nodes, wrong
   outer, ordering, recompile removing it, missing AllocateDefaultPins) was
   the cause. Reading the evidence that already existed beat testing any of
   them.

0l. **FIXED 2026-08-02. Client discovery ended in a fallback, so "I do not know
   which editor" and "use whichever editor owns the default pipe" were the same
   code path.** `resolvePipeName` finished with
   `return "\\\\.\\pipe\\UE427PuerTSMCP"`. A missing or stale `pipe.txt` did not
   fail; it silently sent every request to whatever owned the compiled-in
   default name. With one editor open that reads as a convenience. With two it
   is a command authoring assets in a project nobody asked it to touch, and
   reporting success.

   `pipe.txt` could not have fixed it either. It carried a pipe name and
   nothing else, which is enough to reach AN editor and says nothing about
   WHICH one answered.

   Replaced by `Saved/MCPPuerTSBridge/session.json`, schema version 1, written
   by staging a temp file and moving it over the target so a reader can never
   observe a partial manifest. It carries the session id, a session nonce, the
   editor PID, the OS process creation time, project and uproject paths, the
   pipe name, the bridge commit and install-manifest hash, creation time, a
   5-second heartbeat and a shutdown state.

   The two halves are separate on purpose:

   - The **nonce** travels with every request and `AcceptCommand` refuses a
     mismatch, at the C++ safety boundary, before anything runs. It is
     regenerated on every editor start, so a client holding a previous
     session's manifest is refused rather than silently retargeted.
   - The **identity stamp** rides on every response, including rejections,
     from `BuildBaseResponse`. The client compares it to what it addressed and
     refuses the reply on a mismatch. Both directions are needed: the nonce
     stops a request reaching the wrong editor, the stamp stops an answer
     arriving from one.

   PID alone cannot establish liveness, because Windows reuses process ids, so
   the manifest records the OS process creation time from `GetProcessTimes` and
   the live editor reports its own. The heartbeat is deliberately NOT the
   liveness test: it runs on the game thread, so a long Blueprint compile stalls
   it while the editor is perfectly alive. Liveness is the PID; the heartbeat is
   context for the error.

   Every refusal is a structured code, surfaced as `session_error_code` on the
   failure envelope so a caller branches on it instead of matching English:
   `session_missing`, `session_unreadable`, `session_schema_unsupported`,
   `session_shut_down`, `session_stale`, `session_not_selected`,
   `session_project_mismatch`, `session_identity_absent`,
   `session_identity_mismatch`.

   Proven live with two UE4.27 editors open at once, `BridgeInstallTest` and
   `Tests\UE427PuerTSMCP`, in `Scripts/session-isolation-acceptance.mjs` across
   four phases. Distinct ids, pids, pipes, nonces and projects; concurrent
   diagnostics from different processes; 12 interleaved read-only requests with
   zero crossed replies; a probe actor spawned in each world absent from the
   other; a forged nonce refused BY THE EDITOR in its own words while the client
   independently refused the reply; a stale advertisement naming a dead pid
   refused before connecting; closing A leaving B serving while A is refused
   with `session_missing` and specifically NOT falling through to B; a restarted
   A issuing a new session id for the same project, with a client pinned to the
   old id refused; and no advertisement surviving either shutdown. `smoke:inspect`
   and `smoke:bt` were run against explicitly selected targets with both editors
   up and reached the right one. Evidence:
   `docs/evidence/session-isolation-{both,a-closed,a-restarted,none}.json`.

   Worth keeping: the acceptance failed twice on its own assertions before it
   passed, both times because the behaviour was right and the assertion was
   reading prose instead of a code. That is what produced `session_error_code`.

0k. **FIXED 2026-08-02 by deferral, after the restoration approach was ruled
   out by an editor crash.** The fix is not to undo the destruction, it is not
   to destroy: `BuildBlueprintFromJSONWithReport` no longer clears the existing
   graph before spawning. The replacement is built ALONGSIDE the old nodes -
   connections resolve only against the new ones, because `NodeMap` is keyed by
   spec id and the old nodes were never in it - and at the end exactly one set
   is deleted: the old graph on success, the new nodes on failure. A failing
   build is therefore non-destructive by construction, and there is nothing for
   rollback to repair.

   Same insight as the removal ledger, one level up: do not destroy until the
   thing that might fail has succeeded.

   Proven: the pre-request graph has two `VariableGet` nodes, one reading the
   removed variable (in the ledger) and one reading a variable that is never
   removed (`getA`, in no ledger). After a failing forced removal, both return -
   `graph_inspect` reports 4 nodes against 4, an identical node-type multiset,
   the variable set byte-identical, the asset file SHA-256 unchanged, no dirty
   package. The truthful-report acceptance, `smoke:inspect`, `smoke:bt` and
   `npm run verify` all still pass, so successful convergence is unchanged.

   **Sibling defect, found and fixed 2026-08-02 in the same place.** The abort
   branch was guarded by `DeferredNodesToRemove.Num() > 0`, which made
   non-destruction a property of `clear_existing_graph` rather than a property
   of failing. An additive build (`clear_existing_graph` false) has no deferred
   nodes, so the branch was skipped entirely and a failing additive build left
   its half-built nodes wired into the caller's graph. The guard is gone: a
   failed build discards what it made, whatever mode it ran in. Asserted
   directly - after a failing additive build the canonical graph hash is
   `f151d724...`, identical to the one before it, and the asset file SHA-256 is
   unchanged.

   **What the proof actually covers, and the one thing it cannot claim.** Node
   types and counts were the whole comparison until now, and they are the
   weakest thing a graph has: they match while every pin default and every link
   is gone. The fixture now carries node positions, a pin default and a data
   link alongside the exec link, and the comparison is the full
   `graph_inspect` payload with `include_pins`, split by population:

   - The three nodes the failing build never touched are the same UObjects and
     are compared byte for byte, `id`, `node_guid` and every `pin_id` included.
     Nothing about them moves.
   - The one node the ledger removed and recreated is a new UObject. Its `id`,
     `node_guid` and pin ids are regenerated by construction - measured as
     `K2Node_VariableGet_7` becoming `_8` - so it is compared by structural
     identity: type, params, position.

   A single whole-payload hash cannot express that split, which is why
   `pre_graph_hash` and `post_failure_graph_hash` differ in the evidence
   (`ce9f7f11...` against `f151d724...`) while `original_graph_preserved` is
   true and `graph_restoration_mismatches` is empty. Asserting byte-identity
   across the recreated node instead would re-add exactly the false negative
   0j was fixed to remove. Evidence:
   `docs/evidence/bp-remove-unlisted-record.json`, key `failed_build_graph`.

   **Original report, kept for the ruled-out approach.**

0k-original. **A failing build's graph rebuild is not undone by the removal rollback**
   (2026-08-02, scoped out of 0j). `clear_existing_graph` defaults true, so a
   failing request replaces the whole event graph from its own spec before the
   failure is detected. Nodes that the ledger never captured - because their
   variables were not being removed - are dropped by that rebuild and not
   restored. Measured: a pre-request graph with `getA` (reading `KeptA`, which
   survives) and `getVictim` (reading the removed variable) comes back from
   rollback with `getVictim` only.

   This is the failing build replacing the graph, not the removal rollback
   losing it, and the two should not be conflated.

   **A whole-graph snapshot was attempted and REVERTED 2026-08-02. It crashes
   the editor.** The shape looked right: clone the live event graph with
   `FEdGraphUtilities::CloneGraph` before any removal, and on failure clear the
   damaged graph and move a fresh clone's nodes back into it. It compiled, and
   the first live run took the editor down with an access violation:

   ```

   The "asset came back with no variables" symptom recorded first was the same
   event seen from the client side: the editor was already dead. `CloneGraph`
   on a live Blueprint event graph, from inside a bridge command on the game
   thread, is not safe as written - `StaticDuplicateObjectEx` dereferenced a
   bad pointer duplicating the graph. Reverted to the last good commit rather
   than shipped. The
   likely reason is that moving cloned nodes into a live `UEdGraph` by
   `Rename` plus `AddNode` bypasses whatever the Blueprint needs to keep its
   ubergraph and skeleton consistent; a correct version probably has to go
   through `FEdGraphUtilities::CloneAndMergeGraphIn` with a real
   `FCompilerResultsLog`, or avoid the destruction entirely by deferring
   `clear_existing_graph` until the build has succeeded.

   Deferral is the better shape and is the same insight that fixed the removal
   itself: do not destroy until the thing that might fail has succeeded. Not
   attempted here.

   Until then the boundary is honest and narrow: a failed `remove_unlisted`
   restores every variable it removed and every reference node it removed, both
   verified; it does not restore graph nodes the failing build's own
   `clear_existing_graph` replacement destroyed. `remove_unlisted.variables`
   therefore stays below live_verified.

0j-original. **Reference-node restoration is captured and attempted but does not land in
   the live graph** (2026-08-02, superseded above). The removal ledger now captures each deleted
   reference node whole - class, name, position, comment, graph, variable
   reference, pin defaults and every pin link - and recreates it on the failure
   path from the ledger rather than from the incoming spec, which is the right
   shape: a request that removes a variable normally stops declaring the nodes
   that read it, so rebuilding from the spec would restore the variable and
   silently drop its graph.

   It does not yet work. The ledger reports `reference_nodes_captured 1` and
   `reference_nodes_recreated 1`, but `graph_inspect` afterwards finds one
   `VariableGet` where the pre-request graph had two, and the reference-location
   comparison reports a mismatch. Two candidate causes, neither confirmed: the
   graph resolved by name may not be the live EventGraph object the failing
   build rebuilt, and the recreated node is given a fresh object name
   (`NAME_None`), so the location string it produces cannot match the captured
   one even when the node is present.

   **The important half works.** `rollback_succeeded` reports **false** for
   exactly this reason, so the system refuses to claim a restoration it cannot
   verify. That is the property 0g was fixed to get: the dangerous failure was
   never the incomplete restore, it was reporting success while data was gone.
   Variable restoration itself is complete and verified (0g), so a failed build
   loses no variable; what is not yet restored is the graph node that read it,
   and that is reported rather than hidden.

   `remove_unlisted.variables` is therefore NOT promoted to live_verified.



0i. **RESOLVED 2026-08-02. Unknown authoring keys are now rejected.** Kept for
   the normalisation, which is the non-obvious part. A node type's accepted
   parameters are its RoutingKeys plus its own pin names, but the first attempt
   to reject on that set **regressed valid specs**: RoutingKeys are declared
   snake_case (`var_name`, `target_class`) while the registry factories read
   camelCase config (`varName`, `targetClass`), converted by
   `RegistryConfigJson`, so the valid four-node fixture failed with `varName`
   reported as unknown. Neither spelling alone is the table.

   `NormalizeParamKey` folds out underscores and case, so `var_name` and
   `varName` are one accepted name while a genuinely wrong key like `variable`
   still matches nothing. Rejection is fatal on that normalised set: the node
   is removed from the graph, reported as `unknown_parameter` with the offending
   keys and the accepted list, and the build fails.

0h. **WITHDRAWN 2026-08-02: this was a mis-diagnosis, and the behaviour is
   correct.** A connection naming an unknown node id was read as a reporting
   gap because `failed_connection_count` and `unresolved_connections` were both
   empty. They are empty because the spec is rejected by
   validate-before-mutate (`MCPPuerTSBridgeBlueprint.cpp`, the `NodeIds`
   check) BEFORE anything is created, returning a named error and no graph
   payload. Reporting counts for a graph that was never built would be the same
   lie in the other direction. The acceptance now asserts exactly that: the
   error names the unknown id, and `data.graph` is absent.



0g. **FIXED 2026-08-02 by a removal ledger, and the fix is proven by the same
   test that exposed the bug.** Kept in full because the false
   `rollback_succeeded` is the part worth remembering.

   **Fix.** A ledger is captured BEFORE any deletion: the whole
   `FBPVariableDescription` (which carries name, pin type, default value,
   category, metadata, replication settings, RepNotify function and VarGuid in
   one struct), the managed-ownership marker, and the variable's graph
   reference locations. On the failure path the transaction is cancelled, the
   ledger is replayed by re-adding each captured description and re-stamping
   its marker, the Blueprint is marked structurally modified and recompiled,
   and only THEN does the asset-creation boundary run - so its package
   dirty-state restore is the final word and the restore's own recompile does
   not leave the package dirty.

   **`rollback_succeeded` is now earned, not asserted.** It is computed by
   re-reading the asset and comparing each restored variable's pin type,
   default value, category and ownership marker against the ledger, plus every
   reference location; any difference becomes a `restoration_mismatch` and the
   flag goes false. The asset boundary's own verdict is ANDed with the
   ledger's, so `cleanup.rollback_succeeded` can no longer be true while a
   removal survived. The response carries `removal_ledger_count`,
   `variables_removed`, `variables_restored`, `reference_nodes_removed`,
   `reference_nodes_restored` and `restoration_mismatches`.

   **Proof.** `Scripts/bp-remove-unlisted-acceptance.mjs` step 8, the test that
   previously failed: a Blueprint with `KeptA/KeptB/KeptC/RollbackVictim`, a
   build declaring only the three with `remove_unlisted.variables` and
   `force_remove_referenced` plus a deliberately unresolvable connection. The
   build fails, and `RollbackVictim` is **restored** - the variable set is
   byte-identical to before the failed build, the asset file's SHA-256 is
   unchanged, no package is dirty, no cleanup errors, and a restart preserves
   the state. The whole acceptance passes warm and cold, `npm run smoke:inspect`
   and `npm run verify` pass.

   **Original report, which stood for one commit.** `blueprint_build` with `remove_unlisted.variables`
   removes the variables, then a later failure in the same command - an
   unresolved graph connection, or in principle a compile error - exits through
   `FailRolledBack`, which cancels the transaction and runs the asset rollback
   boundary. **The removed variables stay removed.** Measured: a Blueprint with
   `KeptA/KeptB/KeptC/RollbackVictim`, a failing build declaring only the three,
   `success false` - and `RollbackVictim` gone afterwards, with the asset
   otherwise unchanged.

   Two independent causes, both mine:

   - `FScopedTransaction::Cancel()` does not restore
     `FBlueprintEditorUtils::RemoveMemberVariable`. The removal was assumed to
     be transactional because it calls `Modify()`; it is not recovered by
     cancelling the scoped transaction in this path.
   - `cleanup.rollback_succeeded` reports **true** anyway, because
     `FBridgeAssetRollback` tracks created assets and package dirty state only.
     It never knew a member was removed, so it correctly reports success for
     what it tracked while the caller reads it as "nothing was lost". A
     rollback report that cannot see the destructive half of the operation is
     worse than no report.

   Deleted reference nodes under `force_remove_referenced` are not restored
   either, for the same reason.

   **Do not rely on `remove_unlisted` surviving a failed build.** It is safe on
   success and safe when the build fails BEFORE the removal pass (validation,
   unsupported scope, blocked removal); the exposure is a failure after
   removal, which the unresolved-connection lever reaches today.

   Fix, not yet implemented: capture each `FBPVariableDescription` (and the
   removed nodes) before deletion and re-add them explicitly on the failure
   path rather than trusting the transaction, then mark the Blueprint
   structurally modified and recompile so the skeleton carries them again. The
   rollback boundary should also grow a removal ledger so
   `rollback_succeeded` cannot be true while a removal survived.

   Related: **a compile failure is not reachable from the current spec
   vocabulary.** Two probes tried to force one - a node reading a
   just-removed variable, and a `Cast` with nothing wired to its `Object` pin -
   and both compiled `UpToDate`. The validator, the node factories and the
   connection resolver catch everything first. So the compile-specific branch
   of the failure path cannot be exercised from outside today; the
   unresolved-connection lever reaches the same `FailRolledBack`.



0. **Cast with a short target_class silently spawns no node, and the build
   report counts the phantom** (found 2026-08-01 by the graph_inspect
   acceptance). `{"type": "Cast", "params": {"target_class":
   "StaticMeshActor"}}` produces a build that reports success with the Cast
   in `node_count` and `node_types`, while no node exists in the graph; the
   full path `/Script/Engine.StaticMeshActor` spawns it correctly. Two
   defects: the registry Cast factory does not resolve reflected short names
   even though the variable type resolver does, and `node_count`/`node_types`
   are computed from the spec entries processed rather than the nodes actually
   added, so a factory returning null is invisible unless a connection touches
   the phantom (`node 'x' spawned no node`). Proven by
   `Scripts/graph-inspect-acceptance.mjs`, whose build-vs-read node-count
   assertion now fails loudly on any silent drop. Both fixes are builder-side
   graph mutation work and are deliberately not part of the inspector change.

0c. **FIXED 2026-08-01 for `behavior_tree_build`. Editor exit persisted
   failed-build transients.** Kept in full because the reproduction is the
   template for the other builders.

   **Fix.** `UMCPPuerTSBridgeService::BuildBehaviorTreeJson` now runs inside a
   rollback boundary (`Private/MCPBridgeAssetRollback.h`). The assets still
   have to be created before the answer is known - `FBTValidator` can only run
   against a real `UBehaviorTree` - but any response carrying errors now
   cancels the transaction and undoes the creation. The two lines that caused
   the leak were an unconditional `Tree->MarkPackageDirty()` /
   `Blackboard->MarkPackageDirty()` that ran even when `Errors.Num() > 0`.

   On failure the boundary cancels the `FScopedTransaction` **first** (its undo
   records reference objects about to be destroyed, so they must be replayed
   while those are live), then per created asset calls
   `AssetRegistry.AssetDeleted`, clears `RF_Public | RF_Standalone`, sets
   `RF_Transient`, renames it into the transient package, and marks it pending
   kill; restores each package's recorded dirty flag; and deletes any file that
   appeared and did not exist beforehand. It then re-checks all three and
   reports anything still dirty, on disk, or in the registry as a
   `cleanup_error` rather than assuming the cleanup worked. Every response,
   success or failure, carries a `cleanup` object:
   `rollback_attempted`, `rollback_succeeded`, `created_assets`,
   `removed_assets`, `dirty_packages_before`, `dirty_packages_after`,
   `files_created`, `files_removed`, `source_control_before`,
   `source_control_after`, `cleanup_errors`. Source control is read with
   `EStateCacheUsage::Use` only - asking the server would itself be the
   operation this must not perform.

   A failed save after a successful build takes the same exit: a half-written
   asset is the same hazard as a half-built one.

   **Verified** by `Scripts/bt-failure-atomicity.mjs` (fixture: the existing
   invalid-node request) and `docs/evidence/bt-failure-atomicity-*.json`. Three
   failed builds in one editor session: registry count 0 after each, no file on
   disk, `dirty_packages_after` empty, no cleanup errors, `p4 opened`
   unchanged, and the inspector - an independent reader - finds no artifact.
   The editor then closed with **no Save Content prompt** in 2.72 s and nothing
   on disk, and a restart confirmed the probe still absent. The BT acceptance's
   cold phase, whose `the failed build wrote nothing to disk (filesystem
   check)` assertion had been failing, now passes end to end, and the close
   after it - whose last step is the invalid-node build - produced no prompt
   and no file.

   **`blueprint_build` converted 2026-08-01, same boundary, no second
   implementation.** The leak was at the command boundary only: the builder
   mutates an asset it is handed, while `BuildBlueprintJson` owns the
   `CreatePackage` / `FKismetEditorUtilities::CreateBlueprint` /
   `AssetRegistry.AssetCreated` sequence and the unconditional
   `Blueprint->MarkPackageDirty()`.

   The fixture had to be chosen with care. `blueprint_build` already validates
   node types, duplicate ids, unknown node ids, component classes and parent
   classes before it creates anything (see "Blueprint build
   validate-before-mutate" above), so none of those specs reach the leak. The
   failures that do are the ones only building can find: an unresolved
   connection, a component that will not attach, a compile error. The probe is
   the cheapest of them, a connection endpoint naming a pin role that does not
   exist on a known node (`begin.nosuchpin`), which is the limitation-20 class
   of failure.

   Measured before the change, `Scripts/bp-failure-atomicity.mjs --observe`:
   the request failed and saved nothing, but the Blueprint was in the Asset
   Registry after each of three attempts and `graph_inspect` found it; on close
   the Save Content prompt appeared at 0.8 s and `BP_AtomicityProbe.uasset` was
   on disk afterwards, with "Don't Save" answered. After the change all three
   attempts leave registry count 0, nothing on disk, `dirty_packages_after`
   empty and no cleanup errors; the editor closed with **no prompt** in 3.27 s;
   a restart confirmed the probe absent. In the same session a successful build
   still compiled `UpToDate`, saved, reported `rollback_attempted false`, and
   survived the restart intact, and `npm run smoke:inspect` passes.

   **`widget_build` converted 2026-08-02, closing the shared pattern.** Widget
   raises the stakes rather than lowering them: `BuildWidgetFromJSON` creates,
   compiles **and saves** inside the library, so on the create path the
   `.uasset` is on disk before the command can judge the compile status. A
   failure after that point would leave a saved file, not merely a dirty
   package, which is why the boundary's file deletion is load-bearing here.
   The create path also gets a `TrackIfOurs` adopter: the command has no
   pointer to the asset until it loads it back, so a library failure partway
   through would otherwise leave an untracked, registered asset behind.

   **What this does and does not prove.** Every widget failure reachable from
   the current spec vocabulary is rejected BEFORE mutation (the eight in
   "Widget build validate-before-mutate" above), so unlike the Behavior Tree
   and Blueprint conversions there is **no pre-fix leak to demonstrate**. The
   boundary here is closing an exposure by construction, not a measured defect.
   `Scripts/wbp-failure-atomicity.mjs` proves what can be proven: four rejected
   specs each leave registry count 0 and no file, `p4 opened` is unchanged, a
   successful build compiles `UpToDate` with three widgets and
   `rollback_attempted false`, a rerun converges (`created false`, still one
   asset), the editor closes with no Save Content prompt in 2.75 s, and a
   restart finds the rejects absent and the good widget intact.

   A test bug worth recording, because it briefly looked like a regression: the
   first version of that script passed a bare tree instead of `{"root": ...}`.
   The client schema rejected all six calls before they reached the editor, so
   the four "rejected" specs passed for the wrong reason and the successful
   build failed. A cleanliness assertion that never reaches the code under test
   passes vacuously; the fixture has to be shown to do the thing it claims to
   reject.

   `widget_build` gained its inspector on 2026-08-02; see the Working row below.

   **Original report** (2026-08-01, by the BT live acceptance). A failed
   `behavior_tree_build` on a fresh path correctly
   saves nothing (proven by the acceptance's filesystem check), but the
   in-memory dirty transient survives, and closing the editor auto-saves it
   to disk AND opens it for `p4 add` - `BT_AcceptanceBadType(.uasset,_BB)`
   hit disk at 16:24:12, seconds after the close request. Every probe asset
   from earlier sessions (`BP_CastWireProbe`, `BP_GateProbe`, ...) shows the
   same saved-plus-opened-for-add pattern, so "unsaved probes vanish on
   restart" was wrong.

   **`Don't Save` does not stop it** (2026-08-01, clean post-reboot
   validation). Sharper reproduction: clear
   `Content/MCPGenerated/BT_AcceptanceBadType(.uasset,_BB)`, run
   `behavior-tree-acceptance.mjs --phase=cold` so its last step leaves the
   failed transient in memory, then close the editor normally and answer the
   `Save Content` prompt `Don't Save`. Both files are on disk again, stamped
   the same second as the close (observed 20:22:13). The prompt's answer is
   not what writes them; the unattended save-on-exit flow is. Consequence for
   the acceptance script: its
   `the failed build wrote nothing to disk (filesystem check)` assertion fails
   on any run that follows a close, because the previous close recreated the
   files. The other twelve cold-phase assertions pass, including
   `an unknown node type is rejected with no save`, so the build itself is
   correct and only the exit flow is at fault.

   **This is NOT the teardown hang.** That earlier claim is withdrawn: see
   defect 0f, where a close with nothing dirty, in a project outside the p4
   workspace, hung identically, and where answering `Don't Save` still left an
   unkillable process. The two are independent, and the log tells them apart -
   a 0c stall has no `LogExit` and no `MCPBridge lifecycle: shutdown begin`
   line at all, because it is a modal waiting for a human, while an 0f hang
   has the whole teardown logged and then silence. Post-0f-fix, a 0c stall
   ends the moment the prompt is answered: measured at 105.9 s parked on the
   modal, then 3.74 s to exit.

   Real fixes are builder-side (purge the transient package when a create-path
   build fails) and editor-side (suppress source-control modals for
   unattended runs); both remain out of scope and tracked here.

0d. **BT editor-graph nodes have no NodeGuid** (found 2026-08-01 on reload).
   Loading a built Behavior Tree logs "missing NodeGuid, this can cause
   deterministic cooking issues please resave package" for every editor graph
   node FBTEditorGraphSync created. Builder-side fix: assign
   `FGuid::NewGuid()` during sync, then resave. Cosmetic in the editor,
   real for deterministic cooking.

0e. **The BT builder silently drops unknown param keys** (found 2026-08-01 by
   the first use of `puerts_behavior_tree_inspect`). Node params use
   snake_case (`blackboard_key`, `wait_time`, `acceptable_radius`); a spec
   that writes `BlackboardKey` or `WaitTime` builds "successfully" with every
   key selector defaulting to SelfActor and every value at its class default.
   `FBTNodeRegistry::ApplyParams` looks up known keys and ignores the rest
   with no warning - the K3 soft-warn pattern (monolith) is the known fix.
   Builder-side work; the tool description now documents the real key names
   and points at the inspector for verification.

0f. **FIXED 2026-08-01. Editor teardown hang: MCPBridgePIEAgent cleaned up too
   late.** Kept in full, including the wrong first answer, because the earlier
   entries in this file blamed the wrong component for three sessions.

   **Symptom.** A graceful editor close destroys the window and sets the
   process exit code, and then the process never finishes exiting. It keeps
   its named pipe listening, keeps `Saved/Logs/<Project>.log` open (which is
   why a later editor writes `<Project>_2.log`), and keeps every
   `Plugins/MCPBridge/Binaries/Win64/*.dll` locked, so the project cannot be
   rebuilt. `taskkill /PID <id> /F /T` answers `There is no running instance
   of the task` and `Stop-Process -Force` silently does nothing. Only a
   reboot clears it.

   **Where it stopped.** Every graceful-close log, across both projects, ends
   on exactly the same line:

   ```
   LogExit: Object subsystem successfully closed.
   ```

   That is `StaticExit` (`Obj.cpp:4588`), bound to `FCoreDelegates::OnExit`
   and broadcast from `AppPreExit` (`LaunchEngineLoop.cpp:5805`). Everything
   after it is log-silent, which is why the window went unexamined for so
   long. The one log that ever reached `Log file closed` got there through
   `FPlatformMisc::RequestExit(1)` after an assert, which skips
   `FEngineLoop::Exit()` entirely.

   **Root cause.** `FMCPBridgePIEAgentModule::StartupModule` creates a
   `UPIEAgentRuntime`, roots it, and calls `Initialize`, which registers two
   things that outlive the object unless explicitly removed
   (`PIEAgentRuntime.cpp:97-106`):

   - a core ticker bound to it with `FTickerDelegate::CreateUObject`
   - an `FOutputDevice` (`FPIEAgentLogSink`) handed to `GLog`, whose backing
     memory that same UObject owns through a `TUniquePtr`

   Both were removed only in `ShutdownModule`, which UE4.27 calls from
   `FModuleManager::UnloadModulesAtShutdown` (`LaunchEngineLoop.cpp:4294`) -
   **after** `StaticExit` has destroyed every UObject. So from `StaticExit`
   onward, `GLog` holds a freed log sink whose `Owner` is a destroyed
   `UPIEAgentRuntime`, and the core ticker holds a delegate to the same dead
   object. The editor stops on the very line `StaticExit` emits.

   **The measurement that found it.** `Scripts/editor-shutdown-acceptance.ps1`
   builds, launches, optionally exercises the bridge, closes the window
   normally, waits for the process to disappear, and builds again. Before the
   fix:

   | Case | MCPBridge | Puerts | FJsEnv created | Close |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | `bare` | off | off | no | 4.1 s |
   | `plugin-off` | off | **on** | no | 4.1 s |
   | `puerts-idle` | on, inert via `-MCPPuerTSBridgeDisabled` | on | **no** | never exits |
   | `bridge-idle` | on | on | yes | never exits |

   Puerts alone is innocent, and `FJsEnv` is irrelevant: `puerts-idle` never
   creates one and still hangs. Removing only `MCPBridgePIEAgent` from
   `MCPBridge.uplugin`, with the whole rest of the bridge running and its pipe
   up, closed in 4.1 s. That is the isolation.

   **A wrong answer worth recording.** The first fix moved the *PuerTS*
   teardown to `OnEnginePreExit`, on the theory that
   `FJsEnvImpl::~FJsEnvImpl` was blocking - `StopPolling` waits on a task it
   dispatched to the game thread (`JsEnvImpl.cpp:187`, `:322`), and
   `node::FreeEnvironment` must pump libuv until the `net.createServer` pipe
   handle that `bootstrap.ts` never closes goes away. The lifecycle logging
   added at the same time disproved it in one run: **the script environment
   released in 0.003 s** and the editor hung anyway. The evidence that had
   pointed at PuerTS - three exited editors whose pipes still accepted
   connections - was a consequence of the hang, not its cause. A process that
   never finishes exiting keeps every handle it owns, pipes included.

   Two measurement mistakes are recorded here because both produced confident
   wrong answers. First, the harness treated "a window titled Unreal Editor
   exists" and the bridge's own module-startup line as readiness; both fire
   during startup, so three early runs closed editors mid-initialisation and
   one of them made a bridge-free editor look like it hung. Readiness is now
   `LogLoad: (Engine Initialization) Total time:` plus a settle. Second, those
   mid-startup closes were ignored rather than obeyed, leaving fully loaded
   editors running that then owned the configured pipe name, so a later
   read-only probe connected to the wrong editor and blocked forever. The
   probe now has a bounded read.

   **Fix.** Release from `FCoreDelegates::OnEnginePreExit`, broadcast at the
   top of `UEngine::PreExit` (`UnrealEngine.cpp:1878`), reached from
   `FEngineLoop::Exit` line 4208 - while the object system is up and the
   ticker and `GLog` are still valid. `ShutdownModule` keeps the same
   idempotent release as a fallback for a module unloaded on its own (hot
   reload, plugin disable), where `OnEnginePreExit` never fires. Applied to
   `MCPBridgePIEAgent`, which is the one that hung, and to `MCPBridgePuerTS`,
   which was releasing `FJsEnv` and calling `Service->RemoveFromRoot()` after
   `StaticExit` had closed the object subsystem - latent rather than fatal,
   but wrong for the same reason. `UMCPPuerTSBridgeService::Shutdown` now also
   deletes `Saved/MCPPuerTSBridge/pipe.txt`, so a closed editor stops
   advertising its pipe to the next client.

   **Result, 2026-08-01, BridgeInstallTest.** Five consecutive
   `bridge-idle` iterations: close 4.1 s each, `process_exited` true, zero
   locked plugin DLLs, no surviving advertisement, build ok after every one.
   `read-only` (a `diagnostic` command completed over the pipe) and `bt-smoke`
   (`npm run smoke:bt` passed) both closed in 4.1 s. `puerts-idle`, the
   smallest case that used to reproduce, now closes in 4.1 s.

   The four pipes still listed on this machine belong to editors that hung
   *before* the fix; they survive until reboot. No editor running the fix has
   left one, which is checked per iteration.

   **Verified on a clean rebooted machine, 2026-08-01.** Full record in
   `reports/shutdown-clean-validation-2026-08-01.md`. Starting from zero
   leftover processes, pipes and advertisements, with the 25 `*.zombielocked*`
   files removed and BridgeInstallTest's `PipeName` restored from the
   temporary `_fix1` suffix to the canonical `..._eb10ef4f`:

   - BridgeInstallTest built (28.7 s), launched, served a read-only
     `diagnostic` (`transaction_id ""`, so it did not transact), passed
     `npm run smoke:bt`, and closed in **4.1 s**.
   - UE427PuerTSMCP, the main test project and the source of two of the four
     original unkillable processes, built (21.9 s), launched, and closed in
     **3.78 s**.
   - Both logs run past `LogExit: Object subsystem successfully closed.` to
     `LogExit: Exiting.` and `Log file closed`. That is the whole point: no
     pre-fix graceful close ever got there.
   - Zero processes, zero pipes and zero advertisements survived either close.
   - The relink that used to fail with
     `LNK1104: cannot open file ...UE4Editor-MCPBridgePuerTS.dll` completed:
     `[3/4] UE4Editor-MCPBridgePuerTS.dll`, 18.5 s.
   - `npm run verify` exit 0: 13 suites, PuerTS pin
     (`Unreal_v1.0.9 @ 838ab762d830`, 1038 files), 206 tools frozen, smoke
     8/0/2 with the two documented skips.

   The binaries were confirmed to carry the fix by reading the built DLL's
   string table rather than trusting the build, because both test projects
   keep their own copy of the plugin and a bridge-repo edit is invisible to
   them until the installer runs or the files are copied. UE427PuerTSMCP's
   copy was still pre-fix and had to be synced first.

   Recovery for an editor already in this state: reboot, or bump
   `[MCPPuerTSBridge] PipeName` and relaunch, since pipe.txt discovery routes
   clients to the new editor automatically. A machine already carrying such
   processes can still build without rebooting: Windows refuses to overwrite
   their locked DLLs but does allow them to be RENAMED, which frees the path
   for the linker. The harness does this before its own build, never before
   the build it measures.

0b. **MultiGate ignores num_outputs** (found 2026-08-01 by the same
   acceptance). `{"type": "MultiGate", "params": {"num_outputs": 4}}` builds a
   MultiGate with the default 2 exec outputs and no warning; the identical key
   on Sequence is honored (probe: Sequence 4, MultiGate 2). Builder-side
   registry config work, same lane as defect 0.

1. call_function requires QUALIFIED names (`Actor.GetActorLocation`); the bare
   name fails with `Function is not approved.` Undocumented. Default allowlist
   is 3 functions and each approved function also needs a hand-written native
   executor (`Approved function has no native executor`, service line ~735).
2. Failed and read-only commands still emit transaction ids and undo warnings.
   Read-only calls should not transact.
3. viewport_screenshot rejects full actor paths other tools return; matches
   short names only (task chip filed).
4. Default writable-property allowlist is 8 entries (Actor.bHidden/Tags/
   ActorLabel, SceneComponent.RelativeLocation/Rotation/Scale3D,
   LightComponentBase.Intensity/LightColor). Configurable via
   `[MCPPuerTSBridge]` ini keys `AllowedFunctions` / `AllowedWritableProperties`;
   neither surface is documented in docs/PUERTS.md.
5. No native map-load tool: the native catalog cannot open a different level.
   Blocks titled-map save probes and Phase F work on a persistent map.
6. Changing a component template does not reach instances already in the
   level. After a rerun changed `DoorMesh` to a Cylinder with
   `WorldGridMaterial` at scale z 3, the actor spawned before that build still
   read `Cube`, `BasicShapeMaterial`, z 2, while an actor spawned after it read
   the new values. The compile does not re-run construction on existing
   instances, so a probe actor has to be respawned to show a template change.
   Cheap to live with; worth knowing before reading a stale viewport as a
   failed write.
7. A struct property written from an object with a misspelled field
   (`{"xx": 2}` for a vector) is accepted and silently leaves the field at its
   previous value. `FJsonObjectConverter` ignores JSON keys that match no
   property. The value shape is checked; individual struct field names are not.
8. **Mostly fixed 2026-08-02** (see "Graph node vocabulary" above). The
   vocabulary was eight types; it is now 26, and Blueprint member variables
   are reachable. What is still missing from the mutator's forty-odd factories
   and from the specs: no Timeline node of any kind, no ForLoop or
   ForEachLoop (they are macro instances, and `MacroInstance` is registered in
   `FBPNodeRegistry` but not advertised here because its `macro_bp`/`macro_name`
   pair is not documented and the engine macro library path was not verified),
   no delegate or input node types (registered, not advertised, because they
   need project input settings or a delegate property to point at), and
   `CreateWidget`, which is registered but was not needed once a raw
   `CallFunction` on `WidgetBlueprintLibrary.Create` proved to compile
   (limitation 22). A loop today has to be written as a Delay chain or a Tick
   with a counter variable. The "no widget or audio authoring surface at all"
   this entry used to end with is wrong and was closed on 2026-08-02: audio
   needed no new vocabulary, and widgets have their own tool now. See the two
   Fixed sections below.
9. `physics_build` bodies cannot fire overlap events, so they are not a usable
   mover for a trigger probe. `AStaticMeshActor`'s constructor calls
   `StaticMeshComponent->SetGenerateOverlapEvents(false)`
   (`StaticMeshActor.cpp:33`), and `physics_build` spawns `AStaticMeshActor`,
   so its bodies fail the both-sides test in
   `UPrimitiveComponent::CanComponentsGenerateOverlap`. Repro: `physics_build`
   one simulating cube at `{700,0,1100}` above the same trigger,
   `read_property .../MCP_F2_PhysCube.StaticMeshComponent0
   bGenerateOverlapEvents` -> `false`; PIE, and `physics_observe` shows it at
   rest on the trigger's pedestal at `z 170.00003`, so it passed straight
   through the volume, while the log after that run's `MCP_TRIGGER_ALIVE`
   contains no `MCP_OVERLAP_*` line at all. The same read on the level's own
   `Floor` returns `false` too: every `AStaticMeshActor` is like this. The
   overlapping body has to be a generated Blueprint, whose
   `StaticMeshComponent` keeps the `UPrimitiveComponent` default of `true`.
10. `physics_observe` only iterates `AStaticMeshActor`
    (`MCPPuerTSBridgePhysics.cpp:279`). A JSON-authored Blueprint actor with a
    simulating `StaticMeshComponent` is invisible to it: with only
    `BP_ProbeDropper_C_0` simulating in the PIE world, `physics_observe` with
    no filter returned `{"world":"pie","count":0,"actors":[]}`. So the tool
    that reads runtime transforms cannot see the bodies the authoring tool
    creates, and PIE-time position evidence for a generated actor has to come
    from log output instead.
11. No component-level collision function surface. `SetCollisionProfileName`
    is a `UFUNCTION`, and `blueprint_build` component properties are reflected
    properties only: `{"SetCollisionProfileName": "OverlapAllDynamic"}` and the
    top-level `{"CollisionProfileName": "OverlapAllDynamic"}` are both rejected
    with `StaticMeshComponent has no reflected property by that name.` The
    working spelling is the nested struct, `{"BodyInstance":
    {"CollisionProfileName": "OverlapAllDynamic"}}`, which is not discoverable
    from the schema and is worth a description example.
12. `get_logs` has no cursor. `GetRecentLogs` calls `Since(0, N)`: the ring
    holds 2000 lines, a read returns at most the last 500, and there is no
    `since`/marker parameter, so consecutive reads return overlapping windows
    that a caller has to de-duplicate itself. A PIE start/stop cycle costs
    roughly 70 lines (290 -> 346 -> 416 -> 489 across four cycles in one
    session), so about seven more cycles push a given run's lines out of a
    500-line read. Anchor on content (the last `MCP_TRIGGER_ALIVE`) rather than
    on line counts.
13. `pie_start` takes no options: its schema is `{}`. No map override, no
    player count, no simulate-versus-play, no dedicated server, no run-for-N-
    seconds. It also returns before the session exists ("Play In Editor start
    requested." at 33-107 ms, while `[PIE] Play in editor total start time
    0.145 seconds` appears later), so the caller has to sleep and then poll
    `get_logs`. `pie_stop` is deferred the same way: two `pie_stop` calls in
    one batch gave `success` then `No Play In Editor session is active or
    queued.`
14. During PIE the native allowlist admits only `pie_stop`, `get_logs` and
    `physics_observe` (`MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp:257`). Everything else,
    including `viewport_screenshot`, `spawn_actor` and `read_property`, returns
    `Editor operations are blocked during Play In Editor. Stop PIE first.` So
    there is no screenshot of the running game and no runtime property read;
    a generated Blueprint has to report its own state through `PrintString`.
15. Intermittent, twice observed, not reproduced. (a) `delete_actor
    BP_ProbeTrigger_C_0` answered `Actor not found.` in the request right after
    a `blueprint_build` that recompiled the actor's class, while
    `find_actors` in the next request of the same batch still listed
    `BP_ProbeTrigger_C_0`; a retry deleted it. (b) `find_actors {"name":
    "BP_Probe"}` returned `count 0` in the request right after two deletes and
    two spawns in the same batch, while the spawns had returned
    `BP_ProbeTrigger_C_3` and `BP_ProbeDropper_C_2` and the same query in the
    next server session listed both. Targeted repros of each (spawn then find;
    recompile then delete) both passed, so the trigger is not identified. Treat
    a single miss as worth one retry, not as proof the actor is gone.
    Three more sightings on 2026-08-02, all `read_property` returning
    `Actor not found: BP_ProbeNative_C_0` for one read out of nine against the
    same actor in the same batch, at a different position each run, while the
    other eight succeeded. Still not reproduced on demand. A separate lesson
    from chasing it: `spawn_actor` returns the assigned name, and after a
    delete the next spawn of the same class is `_C_1`, not `_C_0`. Use the
    returned name; do not compute it.
16. A Blueprint variable's default is a string, and it is NOT read back by
    `FProperty::ImportText`. `FBlueprintEditorUtils::PropertyValueFromString_Direct`
    special-cases four structs (`BlueprintEditorUtils.cpp:8983-9015`):
    `FVector` and `FRotator` go through `FDefaultValueHelper::ParseVector` /
    `ParseRotator`, `FTransform` and `FLinearColor` through their own
    `InitFromString`. The two halves disagree, and the asymmetry is not
    symmetric between them either: `ParseRotator` falls back to
    `FRotator::InitFromString` and so accepts `P= Y= R=`, while `ParseVector`
    has no such fallback and rejects `X=0.000 Y=0.000 Z=400.000` with
    `Can't parse default value` at compile time. The builder writes the comma
    triple for vector and rotator and the type's own `ToString` for transform
    and linear color, and writes the CDO through `PropertyValueFromString` so
    only one parser is ever involved. Anything reaching for `ImportText` on a
    Blueprint variable default will hit this.
17. `UScriptStruct::ExportText` is a delta export (`Class.cpp:2916`). Called
    with `Defaults == Value` it emits `()` for any struct that has no native
    `ExportTextItem`, so the value silently vanishes. `FVector` has one and
    looked correct; `FRotator` has none and read back as all zeroes. Pass a
    null `Defaults`.
18. `viewport_screenshot` fits the requested actors but from a fixed distance
    that depends on how many were requested: the door and the dropper together
    (1080 uu apart vertically) framed the whole level and left the door a few
    dozen pixels tall, while the door alone framed usefully. For readable
    evidence, request the one actor that matters. Filed alongside limitation 3.
19. An array or set variable takes no `default` in the build spec. The value
    would have to be Unreal's array import text, which is a second grammar for
    a caller to get right for no gain; entries are set from the graph instead.
    Rejected by name with that reason.
20. **FIXED 2026-08-02, Phase F4. Kept for the record.**
    **A graph connection that cannot be resolved is a log line, not an error.**
    `BuildBlueprintFromJSON` writes
    `BuildBlueprintFromJSON: Could not resolve pins for connection A -> B` to
    the editor log and carries on, and `blueprint_build` still answers
    `compile_status "UpToDate"`, `errors []`, `saved true`. The response's
    `connection_count` is the number of connections **requested**, not the
    number made. Repro, and how this was found: the first
    `BP_ProbeDoorV3` build wired `brSnd.exec -> playing.exec` and
    `playing.exec -> printS.exec` against a pure node, both were dropped, and
    the build reported complete success with `connection_count 34`; the fixed
    spec reports 33. A caller has to read `log_output` for
    `Could not resolve pins` to know its graph is whole. The cheapest fix is to
    return the unresolved connections in `errors`, which would also make the
    spec fail before it is saved.
21. **A const `BlueprintCallable` UFUNCTION is a pure K2 node with no exec
    pins.** UHT promotes a const BlueprintCallable function that returns a value
    to `FUNC_BlueprintPure`, so `UAudioComponent::IsPlaying`
    (`AudioComponent.h:505-506`) and `UWidget::GetCachedGeometry`
    (`Widget.h:696-697`) are declared `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)` and still
    have no `exec`/`then`. Wiring exec to one of them hits limitation 20 and
    disappears. Read the declaration for `const`, not for the macro. Both were
    wired as pure nodes in the F3 graphs and worked.
22. `BlueprintInternalUseOnly` does **not** stop a directly spawned
    `UK2Node_CallFunction`. `UWidgetBlueprintLibrary::Create` carries
    `meta=(BlueprintInternalUseOnly="true")`, which only makes
    `UEdGraphSchema_K2::CanUserKismetCallFunction` (`EdGraphSchema_K2.cpp:932`)
    answer false and keep the function out of the palette; a node built with
    `SetFromFunction` compiles `UpToDate` and runs. `BP_ProbeHUDHost` creates
    its widget that way. `FBPNodeRegistry` does register a `CreateWidget`
    factory for `UK2Node_CreateWidget` (`BPNodeFactory.cpp:325`, config key
    `widgetClass`), but it stays unadvertised alongside the delegate, input and
    macro factories, and was not needed. **Input is no longer in that list**:
    `InputKey` is advertised as of 2026-08-02, because it is the one input
    factory that needs nothing from project settings.
23. **FIXED 2026-08-02, Phase L. Kept for the record.**
    **`blueprint_build` refuses any parent class that is not an Actor.**
    `MCPPuerTSBridgeBlueprint.cpp:375` answered
    `Parent class must derive from Actor: /Script/Engine.SaveGame does not.`
    The engine did not require this: `FKismetEditorUtilities::CanCreateBlueprintOfClass`
    was checked separately on the next line and allows `USaveGame`,
    `UActorComponent` and plain `UObject`. Three consequences met in one chunk:
    no SaveGame subclass (limitation 24); no ActorComponent subclass, so a
    stamina **component** on a pawn was not an available design and the feature
    had to be a Character subclass; and no data-only Blueprint of any kind. The
    fix is the one this entry proposed: the parent check is now the engine's
    own, and the actor-only parts of the spec are gated instead. See the two
    Working rows above and the Fixed section below.
24. **FIXED 2026-08-02, Phase F4. Kept for the record.**
    **A save/load round trip cannot carry a value.** Three doors, all shut.
    `UGameplayStatics::CreateSaveGameObject` refuses the base class by design:
    `if (*SaveGameClass && (*SaveGameClass != USaveGame::StaticClass()))`
    (`GameplayStatics.cpp:2075`), so `/Script/Engine.SaveGame` on the class pin
    yields nothing to save. `USaveGame` itself declares no property, so even a
    live instance would have nowhere to put a float. `SaveDataToSlot` and
    `LoadDataFromSlot` (`GameplayStatics.h:996`, `:1044`), which take a raw byte
    array and would sidestep the class entirely, are **not** `UFUNCTION`s and so
    are unreachable from a graph. With limitation 23 blocking the subclass, the
    value half of the requirement is unreachable today. Observed:
    `MCP_SAVE object_valid=false wrote=false stamina_at_save=0.0`,
    `MCP_LOAD object_valid=false`, and no `Saved/SaveGames` directory on disk
    after three PIE sessions. What *is* proven is the call surface and the
    negative: `SaveGameToSlot` answers false rather than throwing, and
    `MCP_SAVE_PRECHECK slot_exists_at_boot=false` reads the slot at BeginPlay.
    Fixing 23 fixes this. It did: with the SaveGame subclass authorable, none
    of the three doors is on the path any more, and the round trip is proven
    across two PIE sessions. See "Cross-session save and load through generated
    Blueprints" above.
25. **A named child widget of a created UUserWidget cannot be reached from
    another Blueprint.** `UUserWidget::GetWidgetFromName` (`UserWidget.h:1090`)
    and `GetRootWidget` (`:1084`) carry no `UFUNCTION`; `UWidgetTree::FindWidget`
    (`WidgetTree.h:30`) carries none either, and `WidgetTree` is a plain
    `UPROPERTY(Transient)` with no Blueprint access. `UPanelWidget::GetChildAt`
    **is** BlueprintCallable (`PanelWidget.h:36`) but needs a `UPanelWidget` you
    have no way to obtain. The normal UMG answer, a variable on the generated
    widget class, is out because the builder's `VariableGet` is self-scope only
    (`BPNodeFactory.cpp:181`, `scope '%s' not supported in v1 (only 'self')`).
    So `ProgressBar.SetPercent` and `TextBlock.SetText` are not reachable from a
    host graph, and the F4 HUD drives `UWidget::SetRenderOpacity` /
    `SetRenderScale` on the user widget itself instead, reading the value back
    with `GetRenderOpacity`. Three possible fixes, cheapest first: advertise a
    non-self `VariableGet` scope (`FMemberReference::SetExternalMember` already
    exists), give `widget_build` a graph, or add a narrow native
    `GetWidgetByName` helper.
26. **FIXED 2026-08-02, Phase L. Kept for the record, and the diagnosis was
    exactly right.**
    **The `Cast` node type cannot be typed by this builder.**
    `UK2Node_DynamicCast::AllocateDefaultPins` creates its `Object` pin as
    `PC_Wildcard` and resolves the type in `NotifyPinConnectionListChanged`,
    which `UEdGraphPin::MakeLinkTo` never calls. Repro: `Cast` to
    `/Script/Engine.Pawn` with `Object` wired from a `CallFunction`, the
    connection is made and counted, and the compile fails with
    `The type of  Object  is undetermined.  Connect something to  Cast To Pawn  to imply a specific type.`
    The same root cause hits `meta=(DeterminesOutputType=...)`: writing
    `Pin->DefaultObject` on `GameplayStatics.GetActorOfClass`'s `ActorClass`
    fires no `PinDefaultValueChanged`, so its `ReturnValue` stays a wildcard and
    the identical error appears one node downstream. Anything the builder wires
    that depends on a pin-change notification is in this class. The fix is one
    `NotifyPinConnectionListChanged` after `MakeLinkTo`, plus
    `PinDefaultValueChanged` after `ApplyPinDefault`. That is what landed,
    through the public entry points `UEdGraphNode::PinConnectionListChanged`
    (which `UK2Node` overrides to clear a connected input pin's literal and then
    call `NotifyPinConnectionListChanged`) and `PinDefaultValueChanged`, on both
    ends of every connection and after every pin default. See the Fixed section
    below.
25b. **`VariableGet` and `VariableSet` are self-scope only.** Recorded inside
    limitation 25 rather than on its own, and closed with it half-open:
    `scope "target"` with `target_class` now exists and is what the save/load
    round trip uses. It does **not** close 25 itself, because a named child
    widget of a created `UUserWidget` is still not reachable: the widget's own
    generated class has no member variable for it that a host graph could name.
27. **There is no Self node, so "this actor" cannot be used as a value.**
    `UK2Node_Self` has no factory in `FBPNodeRegistry`. An unconnected `self`
    pin on a member function is the blueprint's self and covers the target case,
    but a *parameter* that wants this actor has nothing to wire. The F4 graph
    reaches it the long way round: `Pawn.GetMovementComponent` off the implicit
    self pin, then `PawnMovementComponent.GetPawnOwner`, which hands the pawn
    back already typed and so also dodges limitation 26. Worth a `Self` factory.
28. **A pin default that names no pin is still only a log warning.**
    `ApplyParamsAsPinDefaults` (`BlueprintGraphBuilderLibrary.cpp:483`) logs
    `node '%s' param '%s' %s` and carries on, so a misspelled pin name or a
    value of the wrong shape leaves the pin at its own default and the build
    reports success. This is the same silent-failure class limitation 20 was,
    and after F4 it is the last one left in `blueprint_build`. The fix has the
    same shape: collect the failures and fail the build with them named.
29. **A build that fails after the asset is created leaves an unsaved package
    behind.** Validate-before-mutate covers everything checkable before
    creation; a connection shortfall and a compile error are found afterwards,
    so the package exists in memory, `find_assets` reports it, and the disk does
    not have it. Repro: a rejected `InputKey` spec against
    `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_ProbeInputBad` left `find_assets` `count 1` with no
    `BP_ProbeInputBad.uasset` in `Content/MCPGenerated`, and the entry was gone
    after the next editor restart. Harmless but confusing: unlike the
    pre-validation rejections, `count 0` is not the signal that a build failed.
30. **One editor crash, not reproduced.** `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION reading
    address 0xffffffffffffffff` during a `blueprint_build` that rebuilt the
    198-node F4 graph immediately after the previous command had **created** a
    new `StaticMeshComponent` on the same generated Character Blueprint and
    recompiled it. The editor log ends after the previous command's save; dump
    in `Saved/Crashes/UE4CC-Windows-971305C54CF3274B001FF4AA7117327B_0000`. The
    same command with the same spec, after an editor restart with the component
    already on disk, succeeded and has since run four more times. So the suspect
    is add-component-then-rebuild-large-graph inside one editor session, and it
    is one sighting, not a reproduction.
31. **Nothing in the catalog can press a key.** `InputKey` nodes compile and
    bind, and possession is proven, but there is no input-simulation tool, so an
    input-driven feature cannot be exercised through its input during an
    automated PIE run. The F4 character therefore carries an auto-drive branch
    on Tick that sets the same `bSprintHeld` variable the `LeftShift` node sets,
    and the save and load events fire from the same timeline rather than from
    their `K` and `L` keys. The input path is proven to *build and bind*; it is
    not proven to *fire*, and that is not claimed.
32. **A graph spec is the whole graph, and a Blueprint's variables are
    additive.** `clear_existing_graph` defaults true, so the only way to add a
    node to an existing generated Blueprint is to resend every node it already
    had; there is no node identity to merge against. Variables are the
    opposite: a rerun adds and updates, and a variable the spec stopped
    mentioning stays on the asset forever. Both bit this chunk. Extending the
    F4 character with save and load meant regenerating its whole event graph
    from a fresh generator, and `BP_StaminaCharacter` now carries the previous
    session's 22 variables alongside the current spec's 23, with the overlap
    shared. Neither is wrong, but together they mean a generated Blueprint
    accumulates dead members while its graph cannot be patched. The next
    primitive is node upsert plus a declared-set variable pass; both are
    deliberately out of this chunk.
    **Half open as of 2026-08-01.** The read half landed:
    `puerts_graph_inspect` returns the whole graph, and it put a number on the
    drift this entry described - `BP_StaminaCharacter` carries **37** member
    variables where its current spec declares 23. The write half is untouched
    and is the next capability. Its blocker is named in the Fixed section
    above: a spec's `id` is not persisted on the node, so there is still
    nothing to merge against. An authored node identity that survives save,
    load and recompile is the prerequisite, not the upsert algorithm.
33. **The 200-node cap in `blueprint_build`'s schema is a real ceiling for one
    feature.** The F4 graph is 198 nodes at 252 connections, and roughly a
    quarter of that is string composition: every logged value costs one
    `Conv_*ToString` and about two `Concat_StrStr` nodes, because there is no
    string-literal node and no proven `FormatText` route. A feature that wants
    one more reported number has to give one up. Raising the cap is not the fix
    on its own; a `FormatText` node with typed argument pins would cut the
    logging cost by two thirds.
34. **Moving a Character by writing its capsule's `RelativeLocation` leaves it
    able to fall through the floor.** `set_property` on
    `BP_StaminaCharacter_C_1.CollisionCylinder RelativeLocation` reported
    success and read back the new value, and in the next PIE session the
    character's own graph reported `z=29.4` and then `z=-801`, `z=-2626`,
    `z=-5430`, falling at terminal velocity while its X drifted, i.e. it went
    through the ground rather than standing on it. The same actor class spawned
    fresh with `spawn_actor` at the same place reported `z=110.149994` on every
    tick of a twelve-second run. Deleting and respawning is the reliable move;
    the property write is not. Not diagnosed further.

## Pending capabilities (tracked, deliberately not started)

- **Behavior Tree inspection** - RESOLVED 2026-08-01 evening.
  `puerts_behavior_tree_inspect` landed (InspectBehaviorTreeJson, donor
  references recorded in the implementation notes), passed its two-phase live
  acceptance including an editor restart, and its independent spec comparison
  promoted `puerts_behavior_tree_build` to live_verified. On its FIRST use the
  inspector caught a real defect the builder's own report never showed: the
  acceptance spec's CamelCase param keys were silently dropped (see 0e).
  Evidence: docs/evidence/behavior-tree-acceptance-2026-08-01.txt.

## Unknown (tracked, not explained)

**`puerts_level_load` and `puerts_level_create` reproducibly crash the editor
on level switch** (found 2026-08-05, building a third-person character in
BridgeInstallTest).

Reproduced 3/3, on three different maps, two of them brand new:

1. `puerts_level_load` onto a level saved moments earlier via `puerts_save
level_path=...` (itself fine - save-as-new-path never crashed). The editor
   answered `loaded: true`, then died ~4s later during ordinary Tick:
   `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION reading address 0xffffffffffffffff` inside
   `FTickFunctionTask::DoTask()`.
2. The same `level_path`, second attempt, after a clean relaunch: crashed
   synchronously this time, inside the command itself -
   `UMCPPuerTSBridgeService::LoadLevelJson()` at
   `MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp:1629` (the `UEditorLoadingAndSavingUtils::LoadMap`
   call), reached through PuerTS's own V8/libnode call stack
   (`FJsEnvImpl::UvRunOnce` -> `FFunctionTranslator::Call` -> `execLoadLevelJson`).
3. `puerts_level_create` on a brand-new, never-before-loaded blank map: same
   failure mode, editor gone before the next `puerts_diagnostic`.

Two different crash sites (async Tick vs. synchronous inside the load call)
against three different levels including a fresh one rules out a
level-specific corrupt asset. Native engine map loads that happen without the
bridge - the editor's own `EditorStartupMap` load at process start - never
crashed across five separate launches tonight. Only a *bridge-driven* level
switch crashes. That points at PuerTS's own UObject/JS binding table not
surviving `UWorld` teardown (`CleanupWorld`) during `LoadMap`: something it is
still holding a raw pointer to gets freed mid-switch, and either the next Tick
or the load call itself dereferences it.

Not root-caused further this session: the fault is inside vendored
`Plugins/Puerts` internals (`JsEnvImpl.cpp`, `FunctionTranslator.cpp`), which
`AGENTS.md` calls "pinned" and out of scope for casual edits, and diagnosing a
V8-to-UObject lifetime bug is its own session, not a one-line fix. `FP-5`
(`docs/CONTINUE_HERE.md`) already flagged `puerts_level_create`/
`puerts_level_load`/`puerts_level_save` as implemented but never live-tested;
this is that live test, and it fails. `puerts_level_save` with a `level_path`
(save current level to a new package) does NOT reproduce this and remains
safe - every level-path change made while building the third-person character
went through save-as, never load/create, after the second crash.

**Workaround in place, not a fix:** avoid `puerts_level_load` and
`puerts_level_create` until this is root-caused. Do all work in the level the
editor already has open, and use `puerts_save level_path=...` to move it to a
new package path when needed.

### 2026-08-07: ACCEPTANCE PASSED. `level_load` is out of quarantine.

`L13 -> L17 -> L11 -> L13`, five complete cycles, **15 transitions, 16 loads
including the setup load**. Editor pid 19908, session
`af669f02-463e-4397-d88c-c693e71eb3ab`, unchanged throughout.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| editor crashes | **0**. Same pid alive at the end; no new folder under `Saved/Crashes` |
| `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` | **0** in the log |
| stale binding / dangling UObject errors | **0** |
| loads completed | 16 of 16, each with a `MCPBridge deferred level load complete:` line naming the map |
| map identity after each | correct every time, read from `active_level` on the next call and from `puerts_scene_inspect` at the ends |
| bridge reconnect | never needed. The session never dropped, so the manifest republish is belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing |
| project identity | `Sinfeld_240301` on every response |
| PIE after 15 transitions | start and stop both fine; `BP_SFGameMode_Exploration_C` possessed with `WBP_Canon_HUD_Donathan_C` up |

Command latency confirms the mechanism: `level_load` returns in **3 to 6 ms**
with `scheduled: true`, versus a load that takes seconds. The call is no longer
inside the teardown.

Two observations that are not failures:

1. **The pipe times out on the first command issued during a load.** `LoadMap`
   holds the game thread, so the pipe is not serviced until it finishes, and the
   editor then writes to a client that has already given up:
   `Puerts: Error: MCP pipe socket error: write EPIPE`. Harmless, and inherent to
   a blocking load rather than to this change. Callers should wait before
   polling; roughly 14 s covered a 7,641-actor map here.
2. The asynchronous `FTickFunctionTask::DoTask` crash site never reappeared
   across 15 transitions. That is evidence it shared the root cause, not proof.

`level_create` remains quarantined. It loads the map it creates through its own
path and was not touched or tested by this work.

### 2026-08-06: fix written and compiled, ACCEPTANCE NOT YET RUN

`LoadLevelJson` no longer calls `UEditorLoadingAndSavingUtils::LoadMap` inside
the PuerTS call stack. It validates, records the request in plain `FString`
state, registers a one-shot `FTicker` at delay 0, and returns. `LoadMap` then
runs on the next game-thread tick with V8 unwound. The ticker re-derives the
active world name from `GEditor` rather than trusting the returned pointer,
republishes the session manifest so a client polling across the transition does
not read the editor as dead, and is removed in the service shutdown path so a
scheduled load cannot fire into a service that is going away.

Deliberately NOT a job: `MCPPuerTSBridgeJobs.cpp` states that work holding the
game thread cannot be a job, and `LoadMap` holds it. The command returns
`scheduled: true`, and the caller confirms with `puerts_scene_inspect` or by
calling `level_load` again for the same path.

State as of this entry:

| | |
|---|---|
| `npm run verify` | passes, including the schema budget and the two-sided quarantine test |
| target editor build | 42/42 compiled, `install matches the repository` |
| quarantine | **lifted in code, pending acceptance** |
| acceptance | **NOT RUN.** Needs an editor relaunch and an MCP session restart, because the server registers its tool list at startup |

Required acceptance before this may be called fixed: `L13 -> L17 -> L11 -> L13`,
five complete cycles, 15 transitions. After each: active map path correct,
editor alive, `puerts_diagnostic` succeeds, same project, no stale binding or
UObject errors. Then one PIE start/stop. **If any transition crashes, restore
the `level_load` entry in `puerts-runtime/src/registry.ts` `quarantinedTools`
and in `mcp-server/src/tools/puerts.ts` `QUARANTINED_TOOLS` verbatim from git
history, and record the crash site here.**

`level_create` is untouched and stays quarantined: it loads the map it creates
through its own path, which this fix does not cover.

Second crash site, stated honestly: the synchronous site is pinned by the stack
trace and is what this change addresses. The asynchronous
`FTickFunctionTask::DoTask` site is *consistent with* the same cause but was not
independently reproduced or instrumented. Five cycles rather than one load exist
precisely because a single successful transition would not test it.

**QUARANTINED 2026-08-05, at three boundaries.** The workaround above was a
sentence in a document, which is not a boundary: the tools stayed in
`tools/list`, so the next session would pick one and crash the editor again.
They are now withheld and refused:

1. **Discovery.** `QUARANTINED_TOOLS` in `mcp-server/src/tools/puerts.ts`
   filters both out of `createPuertsTools`. Their specs stay in
   `nativeToolSpecs`, so schemas, annotations and the inventory row survive the
   pause and unquarantining is the removal of one line.
2. **The compatibility alias.** `level_new` fronted `puerts_level_create`, so
   removing the canonical tool alone would have left the crash reachable under
   its legacy name. `createCompatTools` filters any alias whose canonical target
   is quarantined, from the same set.
3. **The runtime.** `quarantinedTools` in `puerts-runtime/src/registry.ts`
   refuses execution before the permission check and before any native call,
   answering `error_code: "capability_quarantined"` with the reason. This is the
   half that stops a stale client, a hand-written pipe request, or a future
   alias, none of which read `tools/list`.

`puerts_diagnostic` now reports `capabilities.available` and
`capabilities.unavailable` derived from those same two structures, so the model
learns a capability is paused by reading, not by calling and crashing the
editor. The skill's `references/tool-catalog.md` lists them under Quarantined
with the reason, generated from `docs/TOOL_INVENTORY.json`.

The two lists sit on opposite sides of the process boundary and cannot import
each other, because the runtime imports `ue`. `mcp-server/tests/puerts-tools.test.ts`
parses the runtime file and fails when they name different tools; that is the
boundary test standing in for generation that is not practical here.

`docs/TOOL_CAPABILITY_METADATA.json` carried
`"verification": "live_verified"` and "Verified over authenticated PuerTS named
pipe connection on UE4.27" for both tools. That was true of a smoke run that
never switched levels, and false as a statement about the tool. Both are now
`pending_live` with the crash recorded; the scoreboard reads `live_verified: 71,
quarantined: 2` instead of 73.

Not enforced in the C++ allowlist as well. The allowlist is compiled into the
editor, so a change there ships only on a rebuild, and the runtime check already
runs strictly before any native call. Add it there if a quarantine ever has to
survive a replaced runtime.

**LIVE ACCEPTANCE PASSED 2026-08-05, 32/32.** `Scripts/quarantine-acceptance.mjs`
(`npm run acceptance:quarantine`) against `BridgeInstallTest` session
`d1682a90`, editor pid 73008, after a full stop / `install:sync` rebuild /
relaunch cycle:

| Condition | Evidence |
|---|---|
| 1. reported unavailable | `capabilities.unavailable` names `level_load` and `level_create` |
| 2. stable reason | `reason_code: "capability_quarantined"` on both |
| 3. absent from discovery | `tools/list` over real stdio, with aliases off and on |
| 4. alias absent | `level_new` absent with `MCP_COMPAT_ALIASES=1`, in a run proven to register aliases |
| 5. runtime refuses | direct pipe request answers `error_code: "capability_quarantined"`, no "Missing permission", no "Tool is not registered", empty `transaction_id`, no `changed_assets` or `changed_actors` |
| 6. editor survived | same `session_id` and pid answered `puerts_diagnostic` before and after two deliberate calls to the crashing tools |
| 7. counts agree | 71 available + 2 unavailable = 73 registry definitions |

Condition 4 asserts the alias-enabled run registered more tools than the plain
one before checking `level_new` is missing. Without that guard the check passes
when the environment variable failed to reach the server, which is exactly what
happened on the first manual attempt through `npm run inspect:list`: no aliases
registered at all, and "level_new is absent" meant nothing.

### The defect the live run caught, which no unit test could

The first acceptance run failed conditions 5a and 5b only: the refusal arrived
with `error_code: undefined` while its message and errors came through intact.

`UMCPPuerTSBridgeService::CompleteCommand` does not forward the script's
response object. It rebuilds the envelope field by field from an allowlist -
`success`, `message`, `data`, `changed_assets`, `changed_actors`, `warnings`,
`errors`, `log_output`, `transaction_id`, `native_duration_ms`. **A field the
runtime sets and that list does not name is dropped silently.** `error_code`
was one, so adding it to `CommandResponse` in TypeScript and setting it in the
registry produced a field that existed everywhere except at the client.

The unit suites could not see this: they mock the pipe, so the C++ normalizer
is not in their path. `MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp` now copies `error_code` when
the script supplied a non-empty one, leaving success envelopes unchanged.

**The general rule this establishes: the result contract is defined in C++, not
in TypeScript.** Any future top-level envelope field - `timings_ms` (item 6),
anything a precondition failure adds beside `data` (item 4) - has to be added
to that allowlist or it will not leave the editor, and only a live run will say
so. Fields nested inside `data` are exempt: `data` is forwarded whole.

## Resolved Unknowns

**`actor_count_total 0` for a full level is a startup race, not a bad
first-call path** (was the tracked Unknown; reproduced and resolved
2026-08-01).

What was recorded: `puerts_diagnostic` answered `actor_count_total 0` once, in
a level that had 12 actors, on the first call after an editor start, with no
repro. Two candidate readings were written down - a real race between editor
startup and the actor query, or a first-call code path that answers before the
world is attached.

It reproduced on the first `puerts_diagnostic` after the editor restart in this
chunk, at no extra cost, and the follow-up call settled it:

- first call: `actor_count_total 0`, `actor_count_measured 0`,
  `json_snapshot_bytes 13`, `native_actor_query_ms 0.0215`,
  `is_game_thread true`, `service_address 000001C4BFA1F380`
- next call, same session, same service address:
  `actor_count_total 12`, `json_snapshot_bytes 1158`,
  `native_actor_query_ms 0.0141`, `is_game_thread true`

**It is the race, and the second reading is refuted.** A first-call path that
answered before the world was attached would have to be a different path, and
there is only one: the same service address, the same query, on the game
thread, in both calls, with the second answering correctly milliseconds later.
The query genuinely ran and genuinely found nothing, because at that instant
the editor world held no actors yet.

The window is real and reachable: the bridge's named pipe is up and accepting
authenticated commands before the map has finished loading. The editor log
puts `MCP PuerTS named pipe ready with 20 approved tools` well before
`[LogLoad] (Engine Initialization) Total time: 43.06 seconds`, and both of the
calls above landed between them.

Not fixed, because the fix is a design decision rather than a bug repair, and
this chunk was scoped to inspection. The honest options, cheapest first: have
`diagnostic` report a `world_ready` flag alongside the count so zero-with-no-
world is distinguishable from zero-with-empty-level; or hold the pipe closed
until the editor's initial map load completes, which trades a clear signal for
a longer startup during which the bridge is simply absent. **The caller-facing
lesson stands either way: a `0` from the first call after an editor start is
not evidence of an empty level. Call twice.**

## Fixed

**Read-only Blueprint graph inspection** (`puerts_graph_inspect`; landed
2026-08-01). The inverse direction of `blueprint_build`, and the first half of
limitation 32: a graph cannot be patched before it can be read. Patching itself
is deliberately **not** in this change.

Most of it was already written. `UBlueprintInspectorLibrary` and its readers -
`ListSCSNodes`, `ListVariables`, `ListGraphs`, `ListFunctions`,
`ListInterfaces`, plus `FBPGraphReader` and `FBPNodeSerializer` - have been
compiled into `MCPBridgeGraphBuilder` all along with no caller, exactly as the
widget builder was. **That is twice now.** Read the module before writing a
subsystem for it.

Four decisions:

- **The reverse type map lives next to the forward one.**
  `UBlueprintGraphBuilderLibrary::GetNodeTypeForNode` is the mirror of the
  dispatch chain in `BuildBlueprintFromJSON`, in the same file, deliberately a
  chain rather than a table: `UK2Node_CustomEvent` derives from
  `UK2Node_Event` and `UK2Node_MultiGate` from `UK2Node_ExecutionSequence`, so
  asking the base first reports both as their base and would rebuild the wrong
  node. A mapping table in the command layer would have been a second place to
  forget a node type; here, a type added to one side and not the other shows up
  immediately as an inspected node whose `type` is null, listed under
  `graph.unmapped_nodes` with the K2 class it could not name.
- **Node identity is observed, and says so.** A node is addressed by its object
  name and its `NodeGuid`. The `id` a build spec wrote is **not persisted
  anywhere on the node**, so an inspected node cannot be matched back to the
  spec line that made it. Synthesising a plausible-looking `id` would have
  hidden exactly the gap that has to be closed next.
- **Read-only is measured, not asserted.** The command is kept out of
  `IsToolMutating`, so no transaction is opened and the response carries no
  transaction id; nothing on the path calls `Modify`, `MarkPackageDirty` or a
  compile; and the package's own dirty flag is read before and after the work
  and returned as `package_dirty_before` / `package_dirty_after`. An annotation
  is a promise, and this one is checkable by the caller.
- **Every array is canonically ordered.** Unreal's array order is an
  implementation detail that a reconstruct, a paste or a load can permute, so
  nodes sort by `NodeGuid`, pins by direction then `PinId`, connections by
  their four endpoint identities, and components, variables, functions and
  graphs by name. JSON *object key* order is `FJsonObject`'s `TMap` and is not
  canonical; a caller comparing runs byte for byte should sort keys first. In
  practice both test payloads came back byte-identical without that step.

Two gaps recorded rather than papered over. `MakeStruct`, `BreakStruct`,
`SpawnActor`, `Select`, `Knot` and `FormatText` hold their configuration in
their pins rather than in a `UPROPERTY`, so they report pin defaults and no
routing params. And a struct pin default other than vector, rotator or linear
color is reported as its raw pin text and named in `graph.lossy_pin_defaults`,
because only those three are written in the comma form the reader can invert.
Neither fired on any graph tested, including the 198-node one.

Three fidelity holes in the pre-existing pin serializer were closed on the way:
it reported `DefaultValue` alone, so every object-pin asset reference and every
`FText` literal in a graph read back as empty, and there was no
`AutogeneratedDefaultValue` to tell an authored default from the node's own.

**A Blueprint no longer has to be an Actor** (was limitation 23; fixed
2026-08-02, Phase L). `BuildBlueprintJson` dropped its own
`IsChildOf(AActor::StaticClass())` check and kept the engine's,
`FKismetEditorUtilities::CanCreateBlueprintOfClass`, which was already on the
next line and allows `USaveGame`, `UActorComponent` and plain `UObject`. What
is genuinely Actor-only is gated per capability instead: a `components` array
needs a SimpleConstructionScript, and `BeginPlay`, `Tick`, `ActorBeginOverlap`,
`ActorEndOverlap` and `InputKey` bind AActor entry points. Both rejections name
the node or the array and the parent class, and both fire before the asset
exists.

Two decisions:

- **Gate the capability, not the parent.** The alternative, an allowlist of
  permitted parent classes, would have needed updating for every base class
  anyone ever wants and would still have said nothing useful about *why*. Five
  node types and one array is the whole actual dependency, and it is written
  down in one predicate, `IsActorOnlyNodeType`.
- **A non-Actor Blueprint still gets a graph.** `FKismetEditorUtilities::CreateBlueprint`
  makes an ubergraph for any `BPTYPE_Normal` Blueprint, so a UObject parent
  takes CustomEvents, CallFunction, Cast, variables and flow. Only the actor
  entry points are missing, which is the truth rather than a restriction.

**Pin-change notifications, so a wildcard pin types itself** (was limitation 26;
fixed 2026-08-02, Phase L). `UEdGraphPin::MakeLinkTo` moves two pointers and
stops. `UEdGraphSchema_K2::TryCreateConnection`, which is what the graph editor
runs, also calls `PinConnectionListChanged` on both ends, and that is where a
node that types a pin from what it is wired to does the work:
`UK2Node_DynamicCast::NotifyPinConnectionListChanged` (`K2Node_DynamicCast.cpp:347`)
promotes its `Object` pin out of `PC_Wildcard`, and
`UK2Node_CallFunction::NotifyPinConnectionListChanged` conforms a
`DeterminesOutputType` output. The same gap existed for pin defaults:
`UK2Node_CallFunction::PinDefaultValueChanged` (`K2Node_CallFunction.cpp:1239`)
is what retypes an output from a class picker. The builder now sends both.

Three decisions:

- **Use the public entry points, not the K2 ones.** `PinConnectionListChanged`
  on `UEdGraphNode` is what the schema calls; `UK2Node`'s override resets a
  connected input pin's autogenerated default before forwarding to
  `NotifyPinConnectionListChanged`. Calling the inner one directly would have
  skipped the literal clearing the editor does.
- **Notify both ends, guarded.** A notification can destroy a pin
  (`bIsBeadFunction` suicide, orphan-pin removal), so each call is behind
  `!Pin->IsPendingKill()`, and connections re-resolve their pins by name each
  iteration rather than caching pointers.
- **`AsResult` rather than a computed pin name.** A cast names its result pin
  `"As"` plus the target type's *display* name, which for
  `BP_StaminaSave_C` is not derivable from the spec. The connection resolver
  takes the role `AsResult` and asks `GetCastResultPin()`.

**Target-scoped variable access** (fixed 2026-08-02, Phase L).
`FBPNodeFactory::CreateVariableGet` / `CreateVariableSet` took `scope` and
refused anything but `self`. They now take `scope "target"` with `targetClass`,
call `FMemberReference::SetExternalMember`, and the node grows a `self` input
pin for the object to act on. The class is loaded and the property is looked up
before the node is created, so a misspelled variable name is refused by the
factory rather than surfacing later as a connection to a pin that does not
exist.

**Unresolved graph connections fail the build** (was limitation 20; fixed
2026-08-02, Phase F4). `UBlueprintGraphBuilderLibrary::BuildBlueprintFromJSONWithReport`
counts the links `MakeLinkTo` actually created and returns one entry per dropped
connection; `BuildBlueprintJson` compares that count against the number the spec
asked for and, on any shortfall, adds an error naming every dropped pair. An
error means the asset is not saved, which the command already enforced.
`graph.connection_count` is now the number **made**, with `connections_requested`
and `unresolved_connections` beside it.

Three decisions:

- **The count is the contract, not the log.** The builder already wrote
  `Could not resolve pins for connection A -> B` to the editor log, and had done
  since it was written. Nothing consumed it. Counting made against requested is
  what turns a log line into a failure, and it is one integer.
- **Each drop says why.** An endpoint that does not read `nodeId.pinRole`, a node
  id that spawned nothing, and a pin role that names no pin of that direction are
  three different mistakes with three different fixes, so the entry names which.
  The third is the common one and its usual cause is limitation 21, so the error
  text says that too.
- **The Blueprint-callable entry point keeps its old signature.** The reporting
  overload is plain C++; `BuildBlueprintFromJSON` forwards to it and discards the
  report, exactly as it behaved before.

It paid for itself inside the same session. The F4 graph's first build wired
`bpSeq.then_0 -> ownSelf.exec` against `UActorComponent::GetOwner`, which is
`const` and therefore pure (limitation 21). Before this change that build would
have answered `compile_status "UpToDate"`, `errors []`, `saved true` with the
character's possession chain quietly unwired, and the failure would have
surfaced later as "the pawn is never possessed", with nothing pointing at the
cause.

**The `InputKey` node type** (part of limitation 8's unadvertised input family;
advertised 2026-08-02). Eleven of the twelve input factories in
`BPNodeFactory_Input.cpp` need a project input mapping to point at: an
`InputAction` node naming an action `DefaultInput.ini` does not declare compiles
clean and never fires, which is why the whole family stayed unadvertised.
`UK2Node_InputKey` is the exception. It binds a literal `FKey` and the factory
rejects a name `EKeys` does not know, so the failure is at build time rather
than at play time. Advertising it cost four lines: the type in
`RegistryNodeTypes()`, its four config keys in the routing-key set so they are
not misread as pin defaults, and the enum entry in `mcp-server/src/tools/puerts.ts`.

## Fixed (earlier)

**Widget authoring** (was the second half of limitation 8's "no widget and no
audio authoring surface at all"; fixed 2026-08-02). `puerts_widget_build` takes
a JSON widget tree and answers with a compiled, saved `UWidgetBlueprint`.

The surprise is that almost none of this was new code. The design spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-18-widget-blueprint-builder-design.md` is marked
"design complete, implementation not started", and the plan repeated that. The
implementation is in fact fully present in `MCPBridgeGraphBuilder`: 1840 lines
across `WidgetBlueprintBuilderLibrary.cpp` and eleven `WidgetBuilder/` files,
compiled into the module every build, with 18 widget types rather than the
spec's 10 and a widget-animation pass the spec never mentions. It had no caller.
So this is the same re-front the Blueprint builder got, not a new subsystem:
`UMCPPuerTSBridgeService::BuildWidgetJson` (156 lines) plus the runtime command
and the MCP schema. **Read the source before believing a spec's status line.**

Three decisions shaped the front:

- **The library owns the grammar; the command owns the contract.** Widget types,
  child-count rules per category, property names and their JSON types all stay
  in `FWidgetClassRegistry` and `FWidgetBlueprintValidator`. The command adds
  the `/Game/MCPGenerated/` limit, a `ValidateWidgetJSON` pass before anything
  is touched, the create-versus-rebuild decision, and the read-back.
- **The response is read back from the asset, not echoed from the request.**
  `DescribeWidget` walks the live `UWidgetTree` from `RootWidget` through
  `UPanelWidget::GetChildAt`, and reports a `UCanvasPanelSlot`'s position and
  size out of `LayoutData.Offsets`. Slot layout is applied by a different code
  path than widget construction, so a tree built with every slot silently at the
  origin would otherwise read as a success.
- **A widget tree converges as a whole, not per widget.** Components and
  variables have stable names to merge against; a widget tree has no identity
  that survives a caller reordering or renaming a node, so a rerun replaces the
  tree of the asset already at that path. That is why the tool is annotated
  `destructiveIdempotent` rather than merely idempotent, and why the description
  says so.

`UWidgetBlueprintFactory` through `FAssetToolsModule` is the creation path the
spec called for and it works unchanged in 4.27; `FKismetEditorUtilities::CompileBlueprint`
compiles a `UWidgetBlueprint` with no special casing. `MCPBridgePuerTS` gained
`UMG` and `UMGEditor` as private dependencies for the read-back only.

**Sound** needed no new code at all. `CallFunction` has never been gated to a
function list - it takes any class and any reflected function - and
`ApplyPinDefault` already loads object pins by asset path, so
`GameplayStatics.SpawnSoundAtLocation` with a `/Engine` SoundWave on its `Sound`
pin was reachable from the 26-type vocabulary as it stood. What the earlier
session read as "no audio authoring surface" was a vocabulary that already
covered it. The work was picking a proof: `SpawnSoundAtLocation` returns the
`UAudioComponent`, and `PlaySoundAtLocation` returns void, so only the former
can be checked afterwards.

**Blueprint variables and the mutator node registry** (was limitation 8; fixed
2026-08-02). `puerts_blueprint_build` now takes `variables` and its graph
vocabulary is 26 node types instead of eight.

Two decisions shaped this:

- **The registry is consulted, not copied.** `BuildBlueprintFromJSON` keeps a
  local dispatch case for the eleven types where the builder wants control of
  the shape (the three actor events, Tick, PrintString, CallFunction, Operator,
  Delay, Branch, Sequence, Comment) and asks `FBPNodeRegistry::Find` for
  everything else, passing the node's `params` as the factory's ConfigJson with
  snake_case keys translated in one table. `GetSupportedNodeTypes` builds its
  second half by asking the registry whether a factory is actually registered,
  so a factory that is renamed or removed takes its node type out of the MCP
  schema instead of leaving a type that builds nothing. The enum in
  `mcp-server/src/tools/puerts.ts` and the dispatch cannot diverge without the
  native side rejecting first.
- **Math is a gated table, not a free function call.** Every operator name maps
  to a `UKismetMathLibrary` or `UKismetStringLibrary` function that was checked
  against the 4.27 headers, and an unknown name is refused with the whole list.
  The same functions stay reachable through a raw `CallFunction` node for
  anything the table does not cover; the named form exists so the vocabulary is
  documented and reviewable in one place.

Variables converge like components: same name and same pin type is a no-op with
the default reapplied, a different type is refused rather than retyped, because
retyping drops every graph node that reads the variable. Defaults are checked
against the JSON type rather than coerced from it, which is what caught
`{"type": "bool", "default": "yes"}` being accepted as `true`
(`FJsonValue::TryGetBool` answers yes to `"yes"`), and struct defaults now
reject a key that names no field of the struct, which is limitation 7 closed for
this path.

Two engine gotchas cost a build cycle each and are written up as limitations 16
and 17: the variable-default parser is not `ImportText`, and
`UScriptStruct::ExportText` elides everything when its Defaults pointer equals
its Value pointer.

**Component properties on generated Blueprints** (was limitation 6; fixed
2026-08-01). `puerts_blueprint_build` components now take a `properties` object
applied to the SCS component template, so a generated StaticMeshComponent has a
mesh and materials instead of rendering as a bare gizmo.

`UBlueprintGraphBuilderLibrary::SetComponentProperty` was not used. Despite its
`JsonValue` parameter name it calls `FProperty::ImportText`, which wants Unreal
text format, and it discards the parse result. The new path marshals through
`FJsonObjectConverter`, the same call `ReadObjectPropertyJson` and
`SetObjectPropertyJson` use, with two shapes resolved before the converter sees
them:

- **UObject references load explicitly.** The converter's own route for a
  `UObject*` from a string is `FProperty::ImportText`, and
  `FObjectPropertyBase::ImportText_Internal` ignores its own `bOk`: it sets the
  property to null and still returns a non-null buffer, so the converter reports
  success. An asset path that does not resolve would apply nothing and say it
  worked. The object is loaded with `LoadObject` and checked against the
  property's class instead, and arrays of object references element by element,
  which is how `OverrideMaterials` gets its material.
- **The JSON value's shape is checked against the property category.** The same
  discarded-`ImportText` fallback catches every other type: `"RelativeScale3D":
  "big"` was accepted and silently wrote nothing, and `"Mobility": 7.5` wrote an
  out-of-range enumerator that then tripped an engine ensure inside
  `USceneComponent::PostEditChangeProperty`. A struct now requires an object, an
  array requires an array, a number requires a number, an enum requires a real
  enumerator by name or value. Both were found by probing, after the first
  build; both are rejected before the asset is touched.

Property checks run in the existing validate-before-mutate pass, so a bad
property rejects the whole spec rather than leaving a Blueprint whose mesh is
quietly null. The writable-property allowlist that governs `set_property` on
level actors is deliberately not consulted here: it is eight entries long and
would reject `StaticMesh` outright. The boundary for this tool is the
`/Game/MCPGenerated/` asset-path limit it already enforced.

**Struct and array marshaling, both directions** (was defects 1 and 2; fixed
2026-08-01, commit on bridge/native-consolidation-2026-07-31). Two independent
causes, one per direction:

- READ. The `object_path` branch of `read_property` walked the property in
  TypeScript and serialized it with `Object.keys`. A PuerTS struct wrapper
  exposes its fields as prototype accessors and owns no enumerable keys, so
  every struct flattened to `{}`. A trace build confirmed it: the value was a
  live `/Script/CoreUObject.Vector` whose `own_keys` was `[]` while `.X` read
  `112.00068664550781`. Fixed by routing both target kinds through the native
  `UMCPPuerTSBridgeService::ReadObjectPropertyJson`, which uses
  `FJsonObjectConverter::UPropertyToJsonValue` - the same call the actor branch
  already used, which is why `Tags` and object references had always worked.
- WRITE. `puerts_set_property` published `value` with the empty JSON Schema
  `{}` (from `z.unknown()`). With no type information a client sends structured
  input as JSON text, and the same trace build caught it arriving as
  `kind=string json="{\"x\":10,\"y\":20,\"z\":112}"`. That string failed the
  runtime object validator, and on the actor branch it reached C++ as a string,
  which is the reported
  `LogJson: JsonValueToUProperty - Attempted to import TArray from non-array JSON key`.
  Fixed by publishing a real union schema for `value` and decoding
  JSON-encoded objects and arrays at the MCP server boundary, with the same
  guard at the runtime's last gate before reflection. The write itself now goes
  through native `SetObjectPropertyJson`/`FJsonObjectConverter`, so any
  reflected type works rather than the three hand-coded vector and rotator
  property names.

## Untested

Map/set/FText/FName reads; sky_shader_create rerun behavior; find_assets
path/name filters; undo stack depth. Two-editor pipe isolation is no longer on
this list: it was tested on 2026-08-02 with both editors open and is finding 0l.
Overlap against
a player pawn (nothing in the default game mode moves on its own, and there is
no input-simulation tool in the native catalog, so the only self-propelled
overlap source proven so far is a JSON-authored physics body).

## Finding 0m: install:sync leaves stale UHT generated code when a source file goes away

Confirmed 2026-08-02 by the integration lead, on a live rebuild of
`D:/Unreal Projects/BridgeInstallTest`.

`Scripts/bridge-install.mjs --sync` copies declared files into the target and
then builds. It deliberately does not delete project files, and says so. What
it also does not do is invalidate Unreal Header Tool's generated code, and that
combination has a failure mode with a misleading error.

Sequence that produced it:

1. A source file (`MCPPuerTSBridgeBlueprintMember.cpp`) and a header
   declaration for `PatchBlueprintMembersJson` were present in the target.
2. UHT generated `MCPPuerTSBridgeService.gen.cpp` and
   `MCPPuerTSBridgeService.generated.h` carrying a reflection thunk for that
   `UFUNCTION`.
3. `--sync` restored the header from the repository, where the declaration does
   not exist, and the `.cpp` was removed by hand as the sync output instructs.
4. UHT did not regenerate, because the restored header is not newer than the
   generated file. The stale thunk survived.
5. The build failed with `LNK2019: unresolved external symbol
   PatchBlueprintMembersJson ... referenced in function
   execPatchBlueprintMembersJson`, then `LNK1120`.

The error names a symbol that appears in NEITHER the repository header nor the
target header. Both were checked and both are clean. Grepping
`Intermediate/Build/Win64/UE4Editor/Inc/` is what actually locates it. Someone
reading only the linker output would look for a missing implementation of a
function nobody declared.

Fix that worked: delete the plugin's `Intermediate/` (145 files, all
regenerable build output) and rebuild. A warm incremental build took 1.7
seconds; this one is a full plugin rebuild.

Why this is a bridge finding and not a one-off: the whole point of the install
gate is that a live run proves something about the code under review. This is a
case where the sources match the repository, `install:check` is satisfied on
content, and the BINARY still contains a reflection entry for a command that no
longer exists. Content equality is not build equality.

Open, not yet fixed. Two candidate fixes, neither implemented:

- `--sync` removes `Intermediate/Build/.../Inc/<module>/` for any module whose
  declared header set changed, which is cheap and targeted.
- `install:check` compares the installed registry catalog against the built
  DLL's exported reflection, not just against the source tree. That is the
  check that would have caught this before the build rather than during it.

Related: the same run surfaced `extra:` files in `native_source` (the two
orphan-installed files above), which `install:check` DID catch and refuse. The
content gate works. The build-artifact gate does not exist.

## Finding 0n: three gaps that make a live fixture impossible to reset

**Status update, 2026-08-03:** items 1 and 2 are implemented. Item 1 is
`puerts_delete_asset`: confirmed, `/Game`-limited, reference-aware and verified
against both registry and package-file absence. Item 2 extends
`blueprint_build.remove_unlisted` to MCPManaged components, protects graph
references, bound events and retained children, and reports independent
component convergence. Both pass focused tests, UE4.27 compilation, final link
and install:check. Their live acceptances remain user-gated. Item 3 remains open.
Found by lane H, 2026-08-02, while making the member_patch acceptance
deterministic. Recorded together because they are one practical problem: there
is no way to return a live editor's asset to a known state.

1. **No delete-asset primitive exists in the catalog.** Nothing in the 209
   registrations deletes an asset. `puerts_delete_actor` deletes a level actor,
   which is a different thing.
2. **`blueprint_build`'s `remove_unlisted` rejects the `components` scope as
   unsupported.** So there is no downward convergence on components: a build can
   add a component and cannot take one away.
3. **Unlinking the `.uasset` does not reseed a live editor.** The package is
   already loaded, so the next build finds the in-memory object and the file on
   disk is irrelevant.

Together these mean a fixture cannot be restored in place while the editor is
running, which is why the previous member_patch acceptance was order dependent
and why two live runs of it disagreed.

Lane H's workaround is sound and does not need any of the three fixed: build the
fixture at a fresh path per run (`BP_MemberProbe_<runId>`) and assert the path
did not exist by requiring `graph_inspect` to fail on it first. Determinism
comes from never reusing a path, not from cleaning one up.

Worth fixing anyway, because the workaround only helps tests. A caller
authoring real content needs (1) and (2) to converge downward at all, and the
absence of (2) means `remove_unlisted` is convergent for graphs and not for
components, which is a surprising asymmetry in a command whose whole contract is
convergence.

## Finding 0o: ImportText returning non-null is not a type check

Confirmed by lane H, 2026-08-02, by reading engine source. This is the defect
behind the integrator's first live member_patch run.

`CompareVariableDefault` (`MCPPuerTSBridgeBlueprintMember.cpp:220`) asks whether
a type can hold a value by testing `FProperty::ImportText` for a non-null
return. For a floating point property that is not a test:
`FNumericProperty::ImportText_Internal`
(`Runtime/CoreUObject/Private/UObject/PropertyNumeric.cpp:113`) advances past
`[+-.0-9]`, consumes nothing at all for `"not a number"`, calls
`SetNumericPropertyValueFromString`, and returns non-null.

So the value imports as `0.0`, is classified `Different` rather than
`Unavailable`, and is applied. The applier (`BPVariableOps.cpp:168`) uses the
same non-test, and verification re-reads through the same comparator, which
agrees with itself. `0.0` is written, verified, and saved.

`FIntProperty` does reject, through `UEnum::ParseEnum` returning `INDEX_NONE`,
so an int control passing beside a float failing localises it precisely.

Fix: require the whole buffer consumed, not merely a non-null return. Accept
only when `End != nullptr && *End == '\0'`. It belongs in one shared helper on
`UBlueprintMutatorLibrary` beside `JsonDefaultToImportText`, because THREE call
sites carry the identical non-test: the member validator, `SetVariableDefault`,
and `add_variable`'s default path.

Assigned to lane G with the build lock. The acceptance check stays red until it
lands, on purpose, so the fix has a failing test to turn green.

The general lesson is the one this file keeps recording: a verifier that shares
its comparator with the writer cannot catch the writer being wrong. The member
hash read back through `graph_inspect` is a genuinely independent check; the
default-value comparison was not.

## Finding 0p: a variable's default_value reads back empty after a successful set

**DIAGNOSED, and the READER is the wrong one.** Lane Q, 2026-08-03, measured
live against BridgeInstallTest (editor pid 38608, install:check current before
and after). Rerunnable: `Scripts/member-default-diagnosis.mjs`.

The value is never lost. It is written correctly, stored correctly on the CDO,
and survives to disk. `graph_inspect` reports the one field the engine
deliberately empties.

### The five readings, same variable, same run

One fixture, one float variable `Delta`, one value `0.75`. Columns 2 and 4 are
the same field and are printed separately on purpose, see below.

```
  phase                1 requested  2 description  3 cdo  4 inspector  5 uasset has "0.750000"
  -------------------  -----------  -------------  -----  -----------  -----------------------
  build (no default)   -            ""             0      ""           false
  patch compile:false  0.75         "0.750000"     0.75   "0.750000"   true
  after compile        0.75         ""             0.75   ""           true
  after compile+save   0.75         ""             0.75   ""           false
```

- **2 description** is `FBPVariableDescription::DefaultValue`.
- **3 cdo** is `puerts_read_property` against
  `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_X.Default__BP_X_C`, property `Delta`. Independent of
  everything else in the table: different tool, different native entry point,
  no shared comparator with the writer or the inspector.
- **5 uasset** asks whether the ASCII text `0.750000` appears in the saved
  package. The description is a serialized FString and a float CDO value is
  four raw bytes, so an ASCII hit means the DESCRIPTION carried the value to
  disk, and its absence means the description was empty when the package was
  written.

The three phases differ by one thing each. `patch compile:false` is the writer
alone. `after compile` is the identical batch with `compile: true`, whose
operations are all already satisfied and are skipped, so the compile is the
only thing that happens between those two rows.

### Which of the four candidates

- **(a) the writer: NOT at fault.** Row 2. Immediately after the patch the CDO
  holds `0.75` and the description holds `"0.750000"`.
- **(b) storage: NOT at fault.** Both stores accept the value. Row 2 column 5
  shows it reaching the package.
- **(c) compile: the MECHANISM.** Row 3. A full compile empties the
  description and leaves the CDO alone. This is the engine doing what it says:
  `KismetCompiler.cpp:776-783` copies `Variable.DefaultValue` into the CDO and
  then, for `EKismetCompileType::Full` only, calls `Variable.DefaultValue.Empty()`
  with the comment "We're copying the value to the real CDO, so clear the
  version stored in the blueprint editor data". The description is editor
  scratch. The CDO is storage.
- **(d) the reader: THE DEFECT.** `BPMemberReader.cpp:140` is
  `VO->SetStringField(TEXT("default_value"), V.DefaultValue);`. It reports the
  scratch field. Column 3 and column 4 disagree in rows 3 and 4 and column 3 is
  the one telling the truth.

`FBPVariableOps::SetVariableDefault` already knows this: it calls
`SyncDefaultValueFromCDO` (`BPVariableOps.cpp:30`) after its own mutation for
exactly this reason. What it cannot do is survive a compile it does not own.
`blueprint_member_patch` runs its own `CompileAndReport` after the whole batch
(`MCPPuerTSBridgeBlueprintMember.cpp`, the compile section), and nothing
re-syncs after that. Neither can anything re-sync after a human presses Compile
in the Blueprint editor. Re-syncing after every compile is unwinnable; reading
the right field is not.

### The second defect the same cause produces, which is worse

A converged rerun of `blueprint_member_patch` with `compile: true` **fails and
declares the asset damaged**. Measured, same run:

```
1 verification mismatch(es) after patching members, so nothing was saved.
The rollback did NOT restore the original members: the member hash is
2ca92fad77a3ea1adcb171d03d9b816354a67863, expected
a4ef52297e36e810ea5d2640b661f5807cd3d5a8. Treat this asset as damaged.
```

The chain: `member_structure_hash_sha1` is SHA-1 over `BuildSnapshot`
(`MCPBridgeBlueprintMembers.h`), which includes `ListVariables`, which includes
`default_value`. Every operation in the rerun is satisfied and skipped, so
`Applied.Num() == 0`. The final compile then empties the description, moving the
hash. Verification's third producer fires: "no operation was applied, but the
member hash moved". Rollback cannot restore it because the compile is not the
thing the transaction undoes. The asset is not damaged; the CDO still holds
`0.75`. The damage report is false, and it is the loudest possible false alarm.

This is also why the FIRST patch reports success while the inspector then says
`""`, which is the symptom finding 0p was opened on. On the first patch
`Applied.Num() == 1` and the hash legitimately moves, so neither hash producer
fires, and the operation-satisfied producer re-reads the CDO and is happy. The
patch is right to succeed. The inspector is wrong afterwards.

### The fix, in the reader

`BPMemberReader.cpp:140`. Report the compiled default, falling back to the
description only when there is no compiled property to read:

1. `UClass* GenClass = Blueprint->GeneratedClass;` and
   `UObject* CDO = GenClass ? GenClass->GetDefaultObject(false) : nullptr;`
2. `FProperty* Prop = GenClass ? FindFProperty<FProperty>(GenClass, V.VarName) : nullptr;`
3. When both resolve, `Prop->ExportTextItem(Out, Prop->ContainerPtrToValuePtr<void>(CDO), ..., PPF_SerializedAsImportText)` and report that.
4. Otherwise report `V.DefaultValue`, which is the only source before the
   variable's first full compile.

That is `SyncDefaultValueFromCDO`'s body minus the write. Lift it into one
shared read-only helper and call it from both places, so the reader and the
writer agree on WHERE the default lives without sharing a comparator for WHAT
it is. Note the finding 0o hazard honestly: the member_patch verifier also
reads the CDO. It stays an independent check because it compares by
`FProperty::Identical` against an imported scratch value while the reader
exports to text, and more to the point because the CDO IS the storage.
Agreeing about the location of the truth is not the failure mode 0o described.

Fixing the reader closes both red checks in
`Scripts/bp-member-patch-acceptance.mjs` that trace to this, because a
CDO-derived `default_value` does not move across a compile, so the member hash
stops moving on a converged rerun.

**Do not fix this by calling `SyncDefaultValueFromCDO` after the batch's final
compile.** It would turn this table green and leave the description as a second
source of truth that the next compile from anywhere, including a human pressing
Compile, empties again.

### What was NOT observed

- **No cold reading.** Lane Q had no authority to restart the editor and the
  catalog has no package-reload primitive, so every reading above is from the
  live editor's in-memory objects. `Scripts/member-default-diagnosis.mjs
  --phase=cold` is written and **unrun**; it re-reads the fixture named in
  `docs/evidence/member-default-diagnosis.json` and is meaningful only after a
  restart.
- What the disk says is the closest available substitute and it is not
  ambiguous: after compile and save, `0.750000` is **absent** from the package
  (row 4, column 5) while it was present before the compile (row 2). The
  description reaches disk empty and the value survives only as the CDO's
  serialized bytes. The prediction is therefore that a cold load restores CDO
  `0.75` and description `""`, so the inspector reports `""` cold as well.
  Predicted, not measured.
- Whether the other red check in `bp-member-patch-acceptance.mjs`, `batch
  apply: the patched Blueprint compiles (UpToDateWithWarnings)`, shares this
  cause. Not investigated.
- The run leaves its fixtures behind under `/Game/MCPGenerated/BP_DefaultProbe_*`.
  There is no delete-asset primitive, and each run uses a fresh path.

## Finding 0p: RESOLVED, and it was the reader

Fixed 2026-08-03. Lane Q's diagnosis was correct and is worth keeping as the
method, not just the answer.

`FBPVariableDescription::DefaultValue` is editor scratch.
`KismetCompiler.cpp:776-783` copies it into the CDO on a Full compile and then
calls `Empty()` on it deliberately, with a comment saying why. The CDO is
storage. `BPMemberReader.cpp` reported the scratch, so `default_value` read `""`
for every variable on any Blueprint compiled since the value was set, which is
every variable set through a command that compiles afterwards.

Fixed at the READER. `UBlueprintMutatorLibrary::TryReadVariableDefaultFromCDO`
is one shared read-only helper; `SyncDefaultValueFromCDO` is now that helper
plus a write rather than a second copy of the same reflection walk. The
description remains the fallback, correctly: before a variable's first full
compile there is no generated property and the description is the only answer.

Verified live, the same five-way table lane Q built:

```
phase                requested  description  cdo   inspector  on disk
patch compile:false  0.75       "0.750000"   0.75  "0.750000" true
after compile        0.75       "0.750000"   0.75  "0.750000" true
after compile+save   0.75       "0.750000"   0.75  "0.750000" false
```

Rows 2 and 3 previously read `""` in the inspector column.

The instruction that made this cheap was refusing to touch the writer until the
reader was proven correct. The writer was innocent and an obvious "fix" there
would have added a second source of truth that the next compile empties again.

## Finding 0q: blueprint_member_patch leaves the Blueprint compiling with warnings

Open, found 2026-08-03. The last red check in
`Scripts/bp-member-patch-acceptance.mjs`:
`batch apply: the patched Blueprint compiles (UpToDateWithWarnings)`.

The assertion wants `UpToDate`. Measured control, so this is not a strict
assertion on a normal state: a freshly built Blueprint that has never been
patched reports `compile_status: UpToDate`, both from `blueprint_build` and from
an independent `graph_inspect`. The patched one reports
`UpToDateWithWarnings`.

Not yet established, and the fresh control is deliberately SIMPLER than the
acceptance fixture, so it does not settle this on its own:

- whether the warnings come from the patch operations or from the fixture's own
  event graph, which the control did not have
- what the warnings actually say. `graph_inspect`'s `log_output` and
  `puerts_get_logs` both returned no matching warning lines, so the Blueprint
  compile log is not reachable through any current command. That is its own gap.

The decisive next measurement is one line of work: read `compile_status` on the
FULL acceptance fixture immediately after it is built and before the patch runs.
If it is already `UpToDateWithWarnings`, the patch is innocent and the assertion
is checking the wrong thing. If it is `UpToDate`, the patch introduces the
warnings and the likely cause is named below.

Likely cause if the patch is at fault: the batch does `remove_component Muzzle`
and `rename_component Lamp -> Beacon`, and the fixture's graph references those
components. Removing or renaming a component out from under a graph node leaves
an orphaned reference, which is exactly a compile warning rather than an error.
If so, this is a real capability gap and not a test problem: a member patch that
silently orphans graph references is not convergent in the way a caller assumes.

Second gap this exposed: there is no way to read a Blueprint's compile MESSAGES
through the bridge, only its status. A caller told `UpToDateWithWarnings` cannot
find out what the warnings were without opening the editor, which defeats the
point of an independent inspector.

## Finding 0r: SETTLED. The default write is outside the transaction, and the fix is at the writer

Found 2026-08-03 by running `Scripts/mutator-atomicity.mjs` against the merged
build, immediately after finding 0p was fixed. This is the important one on the
list.

Lever (3), a batch whose first operation lands and whose second cannot:

```
The rollback did NOT restore the original members: the member hash is
01439bb770d2..., expected 1a65950f1f47.... Treat this asset as damaged.
```

The batch is `set_variable_default Ratio 0.75` followed by `add_variable
BadFloat` with a value its type cannot hold. Operation 0 now APPLIES, because
the value mangling behind finding 0o was fixed and `0.75` is finally a valid
float. Operation 1 fails, the batch cancels its transaction and runs the
rollback boundary, and the member hash still moves.

**Why this passed before and fails now, which is the whole point.** The member
structure hash covers `ListVariables`, which includes `default_value`. Before
finding 0p, that field read `""` for every compiled variable, so the hash was
BLIND to defaults: a rollback that failed to restore a default produced an
identical hash and the atomicity check passed. Fixing the reader did not break
atomicity; it made the harness able to see an atomicity hole it had been
reporting green over.

That is the same failure shape as 0o one level up. There, a verifier shared a
comparator with the writer and agreed with it. Here, the verifier could not see
the field at all and agreed by omission. A check that cannot observe the thing
it asserts about is not a check.

Not yet established, and worth measuring before fixing:

- whether the CDO write performed by `SetVariableDefault` is transacted at all.
  `FScopedTransaction` cancel reverts what was recorded through `Modify()`, and
  the default is written to the generated class default object, which may never
  be marked.
- whether the compile that every mutator entry point runs bakes the value in
  somewhere `Cancel()` cannot reach. A cancelled transaction cannot un-run a
  compile; that is already known from finding 0p's second defect.

The distinguishing measurement is cheap: apply `set_variable_default` alone
inside a transaction, cancel it, and read the CDO with `puerts_read_property`.
If the CDO still holds the new value, the write is not transacted and the fix
belongs at the writer, not at the rollback boundary.

Two smaller items from the same run:

- `Scripts/mutator-atomicity.mjs` uses a FIXED fixture path and its control
  operation adds a variable that survives the run, so a second run finds the
  control already satisfied and reports that the control did not move the
  fingerprint. It needs the per-run fresh path lane H gave the member-patch
  acceptance (finding 0n).
- `Scripts/behavior-tree-acceptance.mjs` asserted the catalog by PREFIX, so
  lane O's server-local `bridge_command_status` failed a native-only check it
  was never meant to be part of. Fixed by naming server-local tools explicitly,
  the same rule `mcp-smoke.mjs` already used.

### Finding 0r, settled 2026-08-03

Measured with `Scripts/member-rollback-diagnosis.mjs`, which reads the CDO
through `puerts_read_property`, a different tool and a different native entry
point, so it shares no comparator with the writer or the member inspector.

```
                        before      after a FAILED batch
CDO Ratio               0.5         0.75
member hash             b08e437e    80332fb0
```

**Verdict: the writer.** The value the batch wrote survives a cancelled
transaction. This is not the rollback boundary failing to run; it is a write the
rollback never covered.

Mechanism, and the surprising part is that `Modify()` IS called.
`BPVariableOps.cpp:203` calls `CDO->Modify()` before `ImportText`. But
`UObject::Modify` (`CoreUObject/Private/UObject/Obj.cpp:1208-1230`) delegates to
`SaveToTransactionBuffer`, whose own comment says it "will fail if there isn't a
valid transactor, the object isn't transactional, etc." The return value says
whether the object actually reached the undo buffer, and **the call site
discards it**. A class default object that is not `RF_Transactional` is silently
skipped, so `Cancel()` has nothing to restore and the write stands.

There is a second, independent reason the transaction cannot help: every
mutator entry point recompiles the Blueprint after writing, and a cancelled
transaction cannot un-run a compile. That is already known from 0p.

**The fix is small and the writer already computes half of it.** Line 200 to 201
exports the old value into `OldExported` before the write, and today that
snapshot is used only to decide which child CDOs should follow the new default.
Restoring `OldExported` on the failure path gives the operation a rollback that
does not depend on the transaction buffer at all, which is the right shape here
because the transaction buffer provably does not cover this write.

Recommended, not applied, because it belongs with a compile and a re-run of
`Scripts/mutator-atomicity.mjs`:

1. Capture `OldExported` for every variable a batch will touch, before the first
   mutation.
2. On any failure, re-import those snapshots into the CDO and restore the
   descriptions, then re-read the member hash to decide `rollback_succeeded`
   rather than trusting the undo.
3. Check `CDO->Modify()`'s return value and warn when it is false, so the next
   command that assumes the transaction covers a CDO write finds out at the
   call site rather than in an acceptance three months later.

**Why this went unnoticed for so long, which is the reusable lesson.** The
member structure hash covers `ListVariables`, and `default_value` read empty for
every compiled variable until 0p was fixed. The atomicity check compared two
hashes that were both blind to the field that was not being rolled back, and
passed. A check that cannot observe the thing it asserts about is not a check,
and it is indistinguishable from a passing one until something makes the field
visible.

### Finding 0r, FIXED and live-verified 2026-08-03

`Scripts/mutator-atomicity.mjs`: **all checks passed, twice consecutively**,
including the control that must succeed and must move the fingerprint.

The fix is a snapshot at the boundary, not a repair to the undo system, because
the undo system provably does not cover this write:

- `UBlueprintMutatorLibrary::SnapshotVariableDefaults` records every variable's
  CDO default before the first mutation.
- `RestoreVariableDefaults` puts them back on the failure path, after the asset
  rollback (which can bring a deleted variable back, and a variable has to exist
  before its default can be written) and before the hash read-back that decides
  `rollback_succeeded`.
- `BPVariableOps::SetVariableDefault` now logs when `CDO->Modify()` returns
  false instead of discarding it, so the next author who assumes a transaction
  covers a CDO write finds out at the call site.

Two things the fix got wrong first, both caught by the harness rather than by
reading:

1. `RestoreVariableDefaults` used `CDO->Modify()`, whose default overload marks
   the package dirty. The restore then left a dirty package on the failure path,
   trading a wrong value for a wrong dirty flag. `Modify(false)` is correct here
   precisely because this runs on the path whose contract is "exactly as the
   batch found it".
2. The harness used a FIXED fixture path, so its control added a variable that
   survived the run and the second run reported the control as not moving the
   fingerprint. Now a fresh path per run, the same rule finding 0n records.

Live evidence, second consecutive run green, plus no regression in
`bp-graph-patch-acceptance`, `graph-inspect-acceptance` or
`bp-failure-atomicity`, all of which share the mutator library.

`blueprint_member_patch` remains at ONE red check, finding 0q, which is
unrelated: the patched Blueprint compiles with warnings where a freshly built
one does not.

## Finding 0q: SETTLED. add_event_dispatcher built half an event dispatcher

Settled 2026-08-03 by lane R, live against BridgeInstallTest, `install:check`
current before and after. Rerunnable: `Scripts/member-warning-diagnosis.mjs`.

### The isolation, and it took one run

Seven operations, one at a time, each its own patch, status read after every one:

```
  UpToDate               fixture built, never patched
  UpToDate               0: add_variable Delta
  UpToDate               1: set_variable_default Label
  UpToDate               2: remove_variable Doomed
  UpToDate               3: add_function ProbeStep
  UpToDateWithWarnings   4: add_event_dispatcher OnProbed
      warn: No delegate property found for  OnProbed
  UpToDateWithWarnings   5: rename_component Lamp -> Beacon
  UpToDateWithWarnings   6: remove_component Muzzle
```

Operations 5 and 6 carry operation 4's warning forward; they add none of their
own. **The component operations were innocent**, which is the opposite of what
finding 0q predicted. The predicted cause was a graph reference orphaned by a
rename or a removal, and it was worth writing down that this fixture's graph
never referenced `Lamp` or `Muzzle` at all, so that hypothesis was checkable and
wrong before any code was read.

The clean control, built directly into the same component and variable state and
never patched, reads `UpToDate` from the builder, from `graph_inspect` and from
an independent recompile. So the difference was the patch, not the state.

### The defect

`FBPEventDispatcherOps::AddEventDispatcher` created a signature graph and
nothing else. An event dispatcher is TWO objects: a multicast delegate member
variable, which is the property callers bind and call, and a signature graph
that gives that property its parameter list.

`FKismetCompilerContext::PrecompileFunction` reaches
`FindFProperty<FMulticastDelegateProperty>(NewClass, Context.DelegateSignatureName)`
for any graph in `DelegateSignatureGraphs` (`KismetCompiler.cpp:2038-2045`),
finds nothing, and warns. Every compile of that Blueprint afterwards warns
again, which is why the acceptance saw it on a batch whose last two operations
were components.

The warning was the visible half. The invisible half is worse and is why this is
a capability gap rather than a cosmetic one: **the dispatcher was not bindable,
not callable and not a member at all.** There was no property, so no Bind, Call
or Assign node could reference it, and nothing but `DelegateSignatureGraphs`
knew it existed. The command reported success, `graph_inspect` listed it under
`event_dispatchers`, and both were reading the half that had been built.

### The fix, at the mutator

`FBlueprintEditor::OnAddNewDelegate` (`BlueprintEditor.cpp:8729-8775`) is the
editor's own path and the op now mirrors it step for step:

1. `AddMemberVariable` with `PinCategory = PC_MCDelegate`, FIRST, and fail the
   whole operation if it fails.
2. `CreateNewGraph`, and remove the variable again if the graph cannot be made,
   so the failure path does not leave the other half standing.
3. `bEditable = false`, `CreateDefaultNodesForGraph`,
   `CreateFunctionGraphTerminators`, `AddExtraFunctionFlags`,
   `MarkFunctionEntryAsEditable`.
4. The user-defined pins go on the entry node the SCHEMA made, checked to be
   exactly one. The old code hand-built a second `UK2Node_FunctionEntry`.

`RemoveEventDispatcher` now removes both halves too
(`SMyBlueprint::OnDeleteDelegate`, `SMyBlueprint.cpp:2700-2701`). Removing only
the graph would have left a delegate property with no signature function, which
is the same half-object one direction over.

Two consequences of the property now existing, both handled where the truth is
shared rather than at the command:

- `FBPMemberReader::ListVariables` skips `PC_MCDelegate` descriptions. A
  dispatcher would otherwise appear in `variables` AND `event_dispatchers`. The
  editor's own list excludes delegate properties for the same reason, with the
  same comment (`SMyBlueprint.cpp:1232-1236`).
- `remove_variable` on a dispatcher is refused by name, pointing at
  `remove_event_dispatcher`. Removing the property and leaving the graph would
  reproduce finding 0q exactly, from a different command.

### The second gap 0q recorded is closed, and it was already written

`blueprint_member_patch` now returns `compile_warnings` and `compile_errors`.
`UBlueprintGraphBuilderLibrary::CompileAndReport` has ALWAYS collected them off
the `FCompilerResultsLog`; this call site read `success` and `status` out of that
report and dropped the arrays, while `blueprint_build` fifteen hundred lines away
surfaced the same two fields from the same function. There was no missing
primitive. There was a discarded return value, and it cost this program a
finding that stayed open for a day because the warning text was unreadable.

A batch compiles whether or not any operation applied, so a converged
single-operation call is now also how you read any Blueprint's current compiler
messages, with no new tool. The compile-failure path puts the errors in the
refusal text, because a failed request returns an empty `data`.

### Live evidence

- `Scripts/bp-member-patch-acceptance.mjs`: **all checks passed**, twice
  consecutively warm, including `batch apply: the patched Blueprint compiles
  (UpToDate)`, which is the check finding 0q was opened on. Cold phase after a
  restart: all checks passed.
- `Scripts/member-warning-diagnosis.mjs`: every operation `UpToDate`, no
  warnings, warm and cold.
- `Scripts/mutator-atomicity.mjs`: all checks passed, control included.
- No regression in `bp-graph-patch-acceptance`, `graph-inspect-acceptance` or
  `bp-failure-atomicity`.
- `install:check` before: 5 problems, all of them staleness in this worktree's
  install rather than a code difference (see below). After sync and the live run:
  `install is current`, installed from `df14297`.

### Three smaller things from the same run

1. **`install:check` counted `__pycache__` as undeclared extras.** The editor's
   Python regenerates 39 `.pyc` files inside the TARGET's plugin copy on every
   launch, so a gate that passed after a sync failed again after the next editor
   start, on an install that was otherwise byte-identical. `__pycache__` is now
   in `SKIP_DIRS` beside `Binaries` and `Intermediate`, for the same reason.
2. **A fresh worktree cannot build without `Plugins/Puerts`,** which is
   gitignored and lives only in the main checkout. `npm run build` warns and
   produces an incomplete `Content/JavaScript`, which `install:check` then reports
   as 22 extra files in the target. A directory junction to the main checkout's
   bundle fixes it. Worth a line in AGENTS.md's worktree guidance rather than
   another lane rediscovering it.
3. **UNKNOWN, tracked, not diagnosed.** The same string variable set to the same
   value reads back differently depending on which command set it:
   `set_variable_default Label "patched"` gives `default_value` `"\"patched\""`,
   and `blueprint_build` with `default: "patched"` gives `"patched"`. Both read
   through the same CDO reader, so one of the two writers is storing the JSON
   quoting. Measured, both assets still on disk, in
   `docs/evidence/member-warning-diagnosis.json` under `patched_shape` and
   `clean_shape`. `bp-member-patch-acceptance.mjs` uses a substring test on that
   field and so does not see it. Not chased: one capability per session, and this
   is a different one.

## Finding 0q: SETTLED, and the warning was the small half

Settled 2026-08-03 by lane R, independently re-verified by the integrator.

The first warning-producing operation was not the component work the finding
predicted. Operations applied one at a time:

```
UpToDate               fixture built, never patched
UpToDate               0: add_variable Delta
UpToDate               1: set_variable_default Label
UpToDate               2: remove_variable Doomed
UpToDate               3: add_function ProbeStep
UpToDateWithWarnings   4: add_event_dispatcher OnProbed     <- here
UpToDateWithWarnings   5: rename_component Lamp -> Beacon
UpToDateWithWarnings   6: remove_component Muzzle
```

Operations 5 and 6 only carry op 4's warning forward. The orphaned-graph-
reference hypothesis was checkable and wrong: the fixture's graph never
referenced either component.

Exact text, `KismetCompiler.cpp:2044`: `No delegate property found for
OnProbed`, emitted when `FindFProperty<FMulticastDelegateProperty>` returns null
for a graph in `DelegateSignatureGraphs`.

**The defect is worse than the warning.** An event dispatcher is TWO objects: a
multicast delegate member variable, which is what callers bind and call, and the
graph that gives it a signature. `AddEventDispatcher` created only the graph. So
every dispatcher this command ever made was **not bindable, not callable and not
a member**, while the command reported success and `graph_inspect` listed it.
The compiler warning was the only outward sign, and the acceptance was asserting
on compile status rather than on whether the dispatcher worked, which is why a
silent corruption showed up as a cosmetic red.

Fixed by mirroring `FBlueprintEditor::OnAddNewDelegate` step for step, with
`RemoveEventDispatcher` mirroring `SMyBlueprint::OnDeleteDelegate`, and
`ListVariables` skipping `PC_MCDelegate` descriptions exactly as the editor's own
variable list does.

**The compile-message gap needed no new primitive.** `CompileAndReport` had
always collected the `FCompilerResultsLog` messages and `blueprint_build` had
always surfaced them; `blueprint_member_patch` read `success` and `status` from
the same report and dropped the arrays. It now returns `compile_warnings` and
`compile_errors`. Because a batch compiles whether or not anything applied, a
converged call is now the way to read any Blueprint's compiler messages.

`puerts_blueprint_member_patch` is promoted to `live_verified` on the
integrator's own runs: warm all checks passed, cold all checks passed after a
restart, and `mutator-atomicity` still green with its control.

### New Unknown, recorded not chased

`set_variable_default Label "patched"` reads back `"\"patched\""` while
`blueprint_build` with the same value reads back `"patched"`. Both go through the
same CDO reader, so one of the two WRITERS is storing the JSON quoting. Evidence
in `docs/evidence/member-warning-diagnosis.json`. The acceptance uses a substring
test on that field, which is why it never saw it: a substring assertion passes on
a value that has been quoted twice.
## Finding 0s: the material graph read-only verdict was wrong, and Modify() is the caller's job

Lane I shipped master material graphs READ ONLY, and recorded the reason at the
bottom of `MCPPuerTSBridgeMaterialInstance.cpp` and in the
`material_instance_build` tool description: UE4.27's graph mutators write
outside the undo record, so a failed multi-node build cannot be rolled back.

The evidence was correct. The conclusion was not.

### What is confirmed, by reading 4.27 source

- `UMaterialEditingLibrary::CreateMaterialExpressionEx`
  (`MaterialEditingLibrary.cpp:469`) does `Material->Expressions.Add(NewExpression)`
  with no `Material->Modify()`. Confirmed.
- `ConnectMaterialExpressions` (`:631`) does `Input->Connect(FromIndex, FromExpression)`
  where `Input` is an `FExpressionInput` on the TARGET expression, with no
  `Modify()` on that expression either. Confirmed.

### What that evidence does not mean

The engine's own material editor has exactly the same problem and solves it by
owning `Modify()` at the call site rather than expecting the library to:

    FMaterialEditor::CreateNewMaterialExpression, MaterialEditor.cpp:4344
        const FScopedTransaction Transaction(...);
        Material->Modify();
        ...
        NewExpression = UMaterialEditingLibrary::CreateMaterialExpressionEx(...);

`Modify()` is the caller's responsibility by design. `UObject::Modify`
(`Obj.cpp:1206`) forwards to `SaveToTransactionBuffer` (`UObjectGlobals.cpp:2197`),
which calls `GUndo->SaveObject(Object)` - a serialized snapshot of the object as
it is BEFORE the mutation. One `Modify()` on the UMaterial therefore puts its
`Expressions` array and its own `FExpressionInput` members (BaseColor,
EmissiveColor, Roughness, Normal, ...) into the undo record, and a cancelled
transaction restores them.

### The part that is a real constraint, and what it forces

`Material->Modify()` covers the UMaterial and nothing else. A pre-existing
`UMaterialExpression` whose own inputs get rewritten is NOT covered, because
those inputs live on the expression.

So `material_build` never rewrites one. **Full graph replacement**: every
expression it connects is one it created inside the same transaction, so the
UMaterial is the only pre-existing object it mutates. The old expressions are
dropped from `Material->Expressions` and deliberately NOT marked pending kill,
so a cancel restores an array of pointers to objects that are still alive with
their inputs untouched.

That constraint is also what makes the command convergent, so it costs nothing
that was wanted: the spec is the whole graph, and a rerun produces the same
graph. It is the same bargain `blueprint_build` and `widget_build` already make,
and it is why the annotation is `destructiveIdempotent`.

### The return value is checked, because of finding 0r

`Modify()` returns false when there is no transactor, when the object is not
`RF_Transactional`, or when it lives in a script package. Any of those means the
graph write lands outside the undo record - the exact condition that makes a
multi-node build unrecoverable. `material_build` and `texture_import` both check
it and refuse before writing anything. Finding 0r is the cautionary tale: a
`Modify()` returning false was discarded there and a whole rollback silently did
nothing.

Neither command uses `CreateMaterialExpressionEx` or `ConnectMaterialExpressions`
at all. `NewObject` plus `Expressions.Add` plus `FExpressionInput::Connect` is
the path `puerts_sky_shader_create` already takes, and doing the array write
directly keeps the `Modify()` ownership visible at the call site instead of
buried in a library that does not do it.

### Status

UNCOMPILED. The lane that wrote this holds no build rights, so nothing here has
been through UBT, let alone an editor. The reasoning above is from 4.27 source,
not from a run. What a live run has to prove, in order:

1. `Material->Modify()` returns TRUE for a `UMaterialFactoryNew` asset created
   with `RF_Public | RF_Standalone | RF_Transactional`, and for one loaded off
   disk. If it returns false, the command refuses and says so, which is the
   designed outcome, not a silent failure - but it would mean master material
   graphs really are read-only and this finding is wrong.
2. A deliberately broken spec (a link to an input that does not exist) cancels
   the transaction and leaves an existing material hashing to what it hashed
   before, through `material_inspect` rather than through this command.
3. A rerun of an identical spec produces the same `structure_hash_sha1`.
## Finding 0s: five legacy parameters did not survive the native migration

Found by lane P's vertical slices, fixed by lane U on 2026-08-03. Recorded here
because the shape of it matters more than the five parameters.

AGENTS.md requires legacy capability to be preserved across the migration.
These five were not, and the compat aliases said so in their own descriptions
rather than treating it as a defect:

| Legacy tool | Parameter | Native tool | What the alias did |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actor_spawn` | `name` | `puerts_spawn_actor` | refused, "rename it with call_function" |
| `actor_spawn` | `folder` | `puerts_spawn_actor` | refused, "there is no native folder command" |
| `actor_spawn` | `scale` | `puerts_spawn_actor` | refused, "spawns at unit scale" |
| `level_actors` | `folder_filter` | `puerts_find_actors` | refused, "filter client-side" |
| `level_actors` | `include_transforms` | `puerts_find_actors` | accepted only as `true` |

Verified against `docs/TOOL_INVENTORY.json`, which carries the legacy schemas,
rather than against the aliases: `actor_spawn` is recorded there with
`asset_path, location?, rotation?, scale?, name?, folder?, validate?` and
`level_actors` with `class_filter?, name_filter?, folder_filter?,
include_transforms?, include_components?, limit?`.

**The failure mode is that nothing broke.** Every test passed the whole time. A
parameter that is gone is invisible to a suite that never names it, and the
refusal messages read as design notes rather than as regressions, so they
survived review. `mcp-server/tests/puerts-tools.test.ts::levelCompletionSuite`
now names all five, which is the only thing that makes their absence a failure.

Restored under the SAME names, additively, on 2026-08-03:

- `puerts_spawn_actor` takes `name`, `folder` and `scale`. It finishes the spawn
  through `ApplySceneBatchJson` inside the one transaction the command already
  opens, rather than growing three more native parameters: that command already
  labels, folders and scales an actor, refuses a label another actor holds, and
  verifies by reading the level back.
- `puerts_find_actors` takes `folder_filter` (a PREFIX match, which is what the
  legacy handler's `folder.startswith` did) and `include_transforms`. Either one
  routes the read through `InspectSceneJson`, the same snapshot `scene_inspect`
  reports; neither is on the default path, so the ordinary read stays the cheap
  actor iteration it was, and the response keys a caller already reads (`name`,
  `class_name`, `location`) are unchanged.

`include_transforms` defaulted to true legacy-side and defaults to false on the
native tool. The `level_actors` compat alias states the legacy default rather
than inheriting the native one, so an old caller that never passed the flag
still gets what it always got.
### Finding 0s, NOT A DEFECT: `puerts_sequence_render` was not shipped, and why

**RESOLVED by finding 0u.** It shipped as `puerts_sequence_render_start` on the
asynchronous job API, in exactly the three-command shape this note specified.
Everything below about UE4.27 is still true and is why. One claim it repeated is
not: Lightmass and the render both DO have a public abort in 4.27, see finding
0t.

Lane S built the two Sequencer primitives `docs/VERTICAL_SLICES.md` names first,
`puerts_sequence_inspect` and `puerts_sequence_build`. It did not build the third,
`puerts_sequence_render`, and the reason is a property of UE4.27 rather than a
gap in the lane.

**A native command has at most 30 seconds and holds the game thread.**
`RequestTimeoutMilliseconds` is clamped to `[100, 30000]`
(`MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp:251`), and commands are serialized on the Unreal
game thread by `AcceptCommand`. Rendering three seconds of 720p is not a
30-second job, and a command that times out while the work continues is worse
than no command: the client reports a failure for work that is still running,
and the next command is refused with "Bridge is busy" for as long as it takes.

**Neither UE4.27 render path can complete inside one call.** Both were read in
the engine source rather than assumed:

- **Legacy MovieSceneCapture.** `UAutomatedLevelSequenceCapture` is in the
  editor-only `MovieSceneTools` module and is driven per frame by
  `OnTick(float)` (`AutomatedLevelSequenceCapture.h:131`). The editor's own
  entry point serializes its settings to a JSON manifest and launches a SECOND
  UE process (`MovieSceneCaptureDialogModule.cpp:705`, `:743-744`), and offers
  to close the editor while it runs. Out of process and asynchronous.
- **Movie Render Queue.** It does exist in 4.27, at
  `Engine/Plugins/MovieScene/MovieRenderPipeline`, and it is
  `"EnabledByDefault": false`. `UMoviePipelineQueueEngineSubsystem::RenderQueueWithExecutor`
  starts a render and returns; the pipeline advances through
  `FCoreDelegates::OnBeginFrame` (`MoviePipeline.cpp:256`) and reports through
  `OnExecutorFinished()`. `MoviePipeline.h:61` documents its own shutdown as
  non-blocking. In process, still asynchronous, and behind a disabled plugin.

**What a render command would need, stated so the next lane does not re-derive
it.** Not a longer timeout: a different command shape. Three commands, or one
command with three ops:

1. `sequence_render_start` returns a job id immediately and opens no transaction
   (rendering is not an asset mutation and there is nothing to undo).
2. `sequence_render_status` reports queued / rendering / finished / failed, the
   frame count so far, and the output directory.
3. The editor side holds the job in a small registry keyed by id, subscribes to
   `OnExecutorFinished`, and survives the client disconnecting.

It also needs a decision the bridge cannot make for a project: MRQ is an
optional plugin, so the command must report which path it used and refuse
clearly when neither is available, rather than silently producing nothing.

Until that exists, a cinematic authored by `puerts_sequence_build` is verified by
`puerts_sequence_inspect` and looked at with `puerts_viewport_screenshot`, which
captures one editor viewport frame and cannot follow camera cuts. That is the
honest state of the cinematics domain and it is recorded here rather than
covered by a command that would time out.
## Finding 0s: navigation build is a write the transaction buffer cannot cover, and the engine says so itself

`puerts_nav_build` (lane W, implemented, UNCOMPILED) is mutating and is
deliberately absent from `IsToolMutating`, so no transaction opens around it.
That looks like the AGENTS.md rule "Every tool that modifies editor state is
wrapped in a UE4 transaction" being bent. It is not. The engine's own navigation
build discards the undo stack before it runs:

```cpp
// Editor/UnrealEd/Private/EditorBuildUtils.cpp:395
GEditor->ResetTransaction( NSLOCTEXT("UnrealEd", "RebuildNavigation", "Rebuilding Navigation") );
```

`FEditorBuildUtils::EditorBuild` calls that on `FBuildOptions::BuildAIPaths`
before `TriggerNavigationBuilder`. Navmesh tiles are derived data written by
background generator tasks into an `FNavDataGenerator`, which is not a UObject
the transaction buffer records. A transaction here would produce an undo entry
that restores nothing, which is worse than no entry: it advertises a rollback
that does not exist.

Nothing authored is at risk either way. Navigation data is derived from the
level, so the recovery from a bad build is another build. That is why the tool
is `mutatingIdempotent` and not `destructive`.

### The refusal list is the real work, and the reason is a silent return

`UNavigationSystemV1::Build` returns without building and without complaining
when it has nothing to do:

```cpp
// Runtime/NavigationSystem/Private/NavigationSystem.cpp:3297-3302
const bool bHasWork = IsThereAnywhereToBuildNavigation();
const bool bLockedIgnoreEditor = (NavBuildingLockFlags & ~ENavigationBuildLock::NoUpdateInEditor) != 0;
if (!bHasWork || bLockedIgnoreEditor)
{
    return;
}
```

A command that called it blind would report a successful build over a level that
still has no navmesh, and the caller could not tell that from a level that built
correctly. That is the empty-success failure this repo has already been bitten
by once, in the PIE guard. So `BuildNavigationJson` checks each condition itself
and refuses by name: no navigation system, no `NavMeshBoundsVolume`,
`IsNavigationBuildingLocked` with the editor auto-update flag masked out exactly
as `Build` masks it, and `IsThereAnywhereToBuildNavigation` false. The last one
points at `puerts_nav_inspect` and its `nav_mesh_bounds_volumes` versus
`registered_navigation_bounds` split, because those two disagreeing is the usual
cause.

### Blocking is the honest problem, and it is not solvable at this layer

`Build` blocks: it calls `EnsureBuildCompletion` on every nav data
(`NavigationSystem.cpp:3329-3335`). The editor-side pipe deadline clamps at 30
seconds (`MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp:251`), and the runtime's per-tool
`executionTimeoutMs` is a `Promise.race` timer that a synchronous native call
cannot yield to. So a blocking build on a large level dies at the socket while
the game thread is still inside it, and the build finishes anyway with nobody
listening.

`wait` therefore defaults to **false** and calls the public non-blocking
`ANavigationData::RebuildAll` (`NavigationData.h:619`) on every registered nav
data, answering `status: "building"` with `remaining_build_tasks`. The caller
polls `puerts_nav_inspect` until that is zero. `wait: true` is the blocking
editor-equivalent path, kept because it is the only one that converges in a
single call, and its description says plainly that it can outlast the deadline.

One asymmetry a caller has to know, so the command states it rather than hiding
it: only the blocking path spawns a missing `RecastNavMesh`, because
`UNavigationSystemV1::SpawnMissingNavigationData` is protected
(`NavigationSystem.h:1098`) and `Build` is the only public thing that calls it.
`wait: false` refuses a level with bounds volumes and no nav data actor and
names `wait: true` as the fix, instead of triggering zero generators and
reporting a started build.

**Unknown, and it stays Unknown until an editor runs this.** None of the above
is live-verified. No editor in this lane compiled the plugin, so every claim here
is read from UE4.27 source at `D:/UE/UE_4.27` and from the command's own logic.
In particular, whether `ANavigationData::RebuildAll` alone produces a complete
navmesh in the editor without the `ProcessRegistrationCandidates` and
`UpdateInvokers` calls that `Build` makes around it is NOT established. If it
does not, the fix is to make `wait: true` the default and accept the deadline,
not to add a workaround.

## Finding 0t: the AnimBlueprint clear pass exists now, and patch is still not shippable

`docs/REFRONT_MAP.md` group 5 recorded `AnimBlueprintBuilderLibrary` as
convergence-blocked, and quoted the builder's own admission:

```cpp
// AnimBlueprintBuilder/ABPBuilder.cpp, before this lane
// NOTE: v1 Rebuild assumes a clean AnimBP (no existing graph nodes to clear).
// A full implementation would clear existing AnimGraph and state machine nodes first.
```

The consequence was not a missing feature, it was silent duplication. A second
`RebuildAnimBlueprintFromJSON` over the same asset added a second state machine
and a second copy of every state beside the first, and whichever one ended up
wired to the Root pose node was the one that played. `puerts_anim_blueprint_build`
shipped CREATE-ONLY because of it.

### What landed

`FAnimBPBuilder::ClearGeneratedGraph` empties the AnimGraph of everything the
builder generates and `Rebuild` calls it, after the variables compile and before
the graph is populated. Two details are load-bearing:

- It skips nodes whose `CanUserDeleteNode()` is false rather than casting for
  `UAnimGraphNode_Root`. That is the schema's own answer, so anything else
  UE4.27 protects in an AnimGraph is protected here instead of being discovered
  by a crash.
- Removing a `UAnimGraphNode_StateMachine` takes its inner state machine graph
  with it, because `UAnimGraphNode_StateMachineBase::DestroyNode` calls
  `FBlueprintEditorUtils::RemoveGraph`
  (`AnimGraph/Private/AnimGraphNode_StateMachineBase.cpp:153-166`). The states
  and transitions inside are not orphaned in the Blueprint.

The event graph got the same treatment: `Rebuild` now passes
`bClearExistingGraph = true` to `BuildBlueprintFromJSON` where it passed false,
for the same reason.

Also folded in: the AnimGraph lookup existed only inside
`FAnimBPAnimGraphBuilder::Build` and the clear pass needed it too. It is now
`FAnimBPAnimGraphBuilder::FindAnimGraph`, one definition, because a clear pass
and a build pass that disagreed about which graph they meant would clear one and
populate another.

### Why there is still no `anim_blueprint_patch`

Convergence was one of two blockers and the smaller one. The other is unchanged:
a failed rebuild over an existing asset cannot be undone.

`FBridgeAssetRollback` deletes assets the command created. It has no way to
restore the previous contents of an asset that already existed, and
`FKismetEditorUtilities::CompileBlueprint` runs inside the builder between the
transaction and any undo.

The clear pass makes that strictly worse for a patch path, which is worth saying
plainly rather than burying: before, a failed rerun left a DUPLICATED
AnimBlueprint; now it leaves an EMPTIED one. Both are unrecoverable, and the new
failure loses more. That is an acceptable trade for `Rebuild`, which no shipped
command calls, and it is not an acceptable trade for a command in the catalog.

**So `puerts_anim_blueprint_build` stays create-only and no patch command was
added.** The missing half is a content snapshot: duplicate the AnimBlueprint into
a transient package before the first mutation, and on failure put it back. That
is real work with no cheap version, it cannot be written blind because the
restore has to survive a compile, and this lane has no editor to prove it in.

**Unknown.** The clear pass is UNCOMPILED and has never run. What is read from
source is that `FBlueprintEditorUtils::RemoveNode` breaks links then calls
`DestroyNode` (`Kismet2/BlueprintEditorUtils.cpp:2857-2899`) and that the state
machine node's `DestroyNode` removes its sub-graph. What is NOT established is
whether an AnimGraph cleared to a bare Root node compiles clean at the point
`Rebuild` reaches its final compile, or whether anything else in the
AnimBlueprint holds a reference to the removed state machine graph that
`RemoveGraph` does not clear.

### Finding 0t, UNBLOCKED 2026-08-03 by lane Y. The snapshot was already on disk

`anim_blueprint_patch` exists. What changed is not that someone finally wrote
the expensive thing 0t asked for; it is that the expensive thing was not needed.

**The version everyone assumed, and why it is wrong.** Both 0t and
`docs/REFRONT_MAP.md` describe the missing half as "duplicate the AnimBlueprint
into a transient package before the first mutation, and on failure put it back".
That is a real UE4.27 mechanism and the engine's own Blueprint merge tool uses
it (`Developer/Merge/Private/SBlueprintMerge.cpp:337-356` takes the duplicate,
`:485` restores it through `FKismetEditorUtilities::ReplaceBlueprint`). Reading
what it costs before writing it is what changed the answer:

- `ReplaceBlueprint` duplicates through `UBlueprint::PostDuplicate`, and
  `FBlueprintEditorUtils::PostDuplicateBlueprint` generates a NEW Blueprint
  guid, a new `VarGuid` for every variable and a new `NodeGuid` for every node,
  then builds a fresh generated class and does NOT carry the old CDO's property
  values across. It moves the SCS, component templates and timelines and nothing
  else. So the restore drops every variable default, which is finding 0r
  arriving from the other end and by a route the atomicity harness would not
  have caught, because the anim structure hash covers
  `variable|<name>|<category>` and not the default.
- The transient duplicate has to survive the compile it exists to protect
  against, and `FBlueprintCompilationManager` collects garbage. An unrooted
  snapshot is a dangling pointer waiting for a slow build.
- After the mutating compile reinstances the class, the snapshot's
  `GeneratedClass` refers to a trashed `REINST_` class, and
  `PostDuplicateBlueprint` dereferences exactly that pointer behind a
  `check(OldCDO != nullptr)`.

**The version that shipped.** The `.uasset` on disk is already a byte-exact
snapshot that holds the generated class and its CDO, because both are
serialized into the package. `FBridgeContentSnapshot`
(`MCPBridgePuerTS/Private/MCPBridgeContentSnapshot.h`) is thirty lines around
that fact: `Capture` REFUSES unless the asset is saved and clean, and `Restore`
is `UPackageTools::ReloadPackages` with `AssumePositive`, which is the same
operation the Content Browser's Reload performs and which the engine already
wires to Blueprint reinstancing through `UPackageTools::HandlePackageReloaded`.

**The property that makes it safe, and it is not the reload.** The command
writes nothing to disk until the compile and the `anim_blueprint_inspect`
read-back have both passed. So at every failure exit the file is untouched, and
even a `Restore()` that fails outright leaves a recoverable asset: the worst
case is a wrong object in memory, which reopening the editor fixes. That is the
whole difference from 0t's emptied AnimBlueprint, which was unrecoverable
because it had already been saved. Lane W's conclusion that the clear pass made
failure worse was correct about the mechanism and wrong about the ceiling: what
made it unrecoverable was the save, not the clear.

`rollback_succeeded` is decided by re-reading the structure hash after the
restore and comparing it to the pre-patch read, not asserted. Finding 0r's rule,
applied to whole-asset content.

**What a snapshot of this kind CANNOT capture**, stated because the precondition
is the price:

- Unsaved in-memory edits. There is no on-disk representation of them, so
  `Capture` refuses rather than silently discard them on the failure path.
- The undo history. The reload destroys the objects the undo records point at,
  so `Restore` resets the transaction buffer, the same thing
  `FBlueprintUnloader` does when it unloads a Blueprint. Reported in
  `restore.undo_history_cleared`.
- The editor's selection sets, which `UPackageTools::ReloadPackages` resets.

**Unknown, and this is the honest bottom of the lane.** All of it is UNCOMPILED
and has never run: this lane holds no build rights and no editor. Four things
are read from source and not established live.

1. Whether `UPackageTools::ReloadPackages` succeeds on a package whose
   `UAnimBlueprint` was mutated and compiled in the same tick.
2. Whether `GEditor->Trans->Reset` is safe at that point.
   `UTransBuffer::Reset` tolerates a non-zero `ActiveCount` (it logs and calls
   `Cancel(0)`, `EditorTransaction.cpp:1243-1277`) and the command cancels its
   transaction first, so the count should be zero. Read, not measured.
3. Whether `anim_blueprint_inspect`'s `structure_hash_sha1` is stable across a
   converged rerun. It probably is NOT: `NodeIdentity` embeds
   `Node->GetName()`, and a clear-and-rebuild reassigns those names. The command
   says so in `convergence_note` and the acceptance records both hashes without
   asserting they match, so the first live run answers this rather than failing
   on it.
4. Lane W's own Unknown is unchanged: whether an AnimGraph cleared to a bare
   Root node compiles clean.

Acceptance written and NOT run: `Scripts/animbp-patch-atomicity.mjs`. Its lever
(2) is the one that matters - an unknown pipeline node type passes
`FAnimBPValidator` (whose Rule 6 only counts StateMachine nodes) and is refused
by `FAnimBPAnimGraphBuilder::Build` at `ABPAnimGraphBuilder.cpp:63-67`, which is
AFTER the clear pass has emptied the graph. Without the restore, that lever
leaves exactly the emptied AnimBlueprint 0t describes. It carries the control
`mutator-atomicity.mjs` taught: a patch that must SUCCEED and must move the
fingerprint, strengthened here to require the added state by NAME in the
read-back, because the hash can move for the uninteresting reason in (3).

## Finding 0u: "Failed to start Swarm" is environmental, and lighting_build should say so

Diagnosed 2026-08-03. Not an MCPBridge or PuerTS defect.

Swarm Agent is the UE4 service CPU Lightmass uses to build static lighting. It
is separate from this plugin entirely. Checked on this machine:

```
PRESENT  Engine/Binaries/DotNET/SwarmAgent.exe        365,024 bytes
PRESENT  Engine/Binaries/Win64/UnrealLightmass.exe  1,096,672 bytes
PRESENT  Engine/Binaries/DotNET/SwarmCommonUtils.dll
PRESENT  Engine/Binaries/DotNET/AgentInterface.dll
```

So the binaries are not missing and the engine does not need rebuilding.
Launched manually, `SwarmAgent.exe` starts and stays up. The failure is
therefore the editor's auto-start of an agent that was not already running:
firewall prompt, a stuck previous instance, or a damaged cache under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%/UnrealEngine/4.27/Saved/Swarm` (5141 files here).

**What this means for the program, which is the actionable half.**

`puerts_lighting_build` currently hands off to Lightmass and reports
`status: building`. If Swarm cannot start, the build never progresses and the
command has already returned success. That is the shape of failure this program
exists to remove: a command that reports what it requested rather than what
happened.

`lighting_build` should check the precondition and refuse by name, exactly as
`nav_build` refuses when there is no NavMeshBoundsVolume:

- is `SwarmAgent.exe` present under the engine root
- is a SwarmAgent process already running, and if not, did starting one work
- report `swarm_available` in the response either way

**And automated tests should not bake lighting at all.** The level slice needs
placed lights and correct transforms, not a Lightmass run. Baked lighting
belongs in the final environment vertical slice, where static lighting is part
of what is being proven, and there Swarm genuinely must work. Any earlier test
that triggers a lighting build is buying a multi-minute external dependency for
a check it does not need.

## Finding 0t: the asynchronous job API, and the class of work it can carry

Lane Z, implemented, UNCOMPILED. `job_status`, `job_result`, `job_cancel`, and
`sequence_render_start`. The whole model lives in `docs/PERF_AND_LONG_JOBS.md`
6.10; this entry records what was learned rather than restating the design.

**The abstraction was real, not speculative.** Two shipped commands had already
hand-rolled half of it. `lighting_build` grew `action: "start" | "status"`
because a Lightmass build outlives any command budget. `nav_build` grew
`wait: false` plus a poll against `nav_inspect` for the same reason. Both were
solving the same problem in different vocabularies, and a caller had to learn
each one separately. They are migrated onto one job API **additively**: no
parameter renamed, no parameter removed, no behaviour changed, one field
(`job_id`) added to each.

**The load-bearing distinction is which thread the work runs on, and it is not
the one the earlier analysis leads you to expect.** `PERF_AND_LONG_JOBS` 6.5
concluded that job-based work needs chunked execution on a ticker, a job slot
beside the command slot, and job-owned transactions, and 6.6 listed six things
each of those breaks. None of that was needed here, because none of these three
jobs holds the game thread in the first place: Lightmass advances on the
editor's own tick, Recast's generator runs background tasks, and a render is a
second process. The job API is a *record*, not an executor. It contains no
`FTicker`, no state machine, no transaction and no second pipe.

The rule that falls out, and the one to check before adding a job kind: **if the
work holds the game thread, a job id around it is decoration.** `nav_build` with
`wait: true` is exactly that, and it returns an empty `job_id` with a warning
saying so rather than a handle to something that cannot be polled or cancelled.

### Correction: Lightmass DOES expose a public abort in UE4.27

`lighting_build`'s description and the `sequence_render` note both said "There
is no cancel: UE4.27 exposes no public entry point for aborting a Lightmass
build." That is wrong, and it was wrong when written.

```cpp
// Editor/UnrealEd/Classes/Editor/EditorEngine.h:816    virtual, public
// Editor/UnrealEd/Classes/Editor/UnrealEdEngine.h:201  the real override
GEditor->SetMapBuildCancelled(true);
```

It is what the editor's own cancel button reaches:
`FStaticLightingManager::CancelLightingBuild` calls it when the build is async
(`StaticLightingSystem.cpp:182-193`), and the build progress dialog calls the
`FUnrealEdMisc` setter directly (`SBuildProgress.cpp:212`). Lightmass reads the
flag between units of its export and import work (`Lightmass.cpp:726`, `:1312`,
`:3385`, `:3479`), so a cancel takes effect at the next check, not at the call.
That is reported as `cancel_effect: "deferred"` rather than papered over.

`UNavigationSystemV1::CancelBuild()` is public too (`NavigationSystem.h:823`),
which nothing in the bridge exposed before.

**The companion change this forces.** `bCancelBuild` is a single global
`FUnrealEdMisc` flag, also read by the CSG builder (`EditorCsg.cpp:303`) and the
streaming-level loops (`EditorServer.cpp:1594`, `:1632`).
`FEditorBuildUtils::EditorBuild` clears it before every build
(`EditorBuildUtils.cpp:248`); `UEditorEngine::BuildLighting`, which is what
`lighting_build` calls, does **not**. So `lighting_build`'s start path now
clears it. Without that one line, a single `job_cancel` would poison every later
build in the editor session: the next start would abort on its first check and
report a build that never ran, which is the empty-success failure this document
exists to catalogue.

### What a job cannot report, which is a percent

Nothing here reports a fraction, and the response says so with a reason, the
same way lane O's status record does. No UE4.27 entry point on any of the three
paths exposes one. What is reported is the counter the engine itself keeps and
which has no denominator: `lighting_unbuilt_objects`, `remaining_build_tasks`,
and for a render `output_file_count`, the number of files written so far. The
render's frame total lives inside the child process and this editor cannot ask
it.

### Two integration defects found on the way, both the same shape

Both are a lane adding to one list and not to its twin, and both were silent.

1. **Four registered tools could not be called at all.** `project.config.read`,
   `project.config.write` and `pie.observe` were added to the `Permission` union
   in `puerts-runtime/src/types.ts` but not to `allPermissions` in
   `registry.ts`, which is the set `ToolRegistry.execute` checks against.
   `input_mapping_info`, `input_mapping_patch`, `folder_visibility` and
   `pie_agent_query` therefore answered "Permission denied. Missing permission:
   ..." on every call. Fixed at the root: the array moved into `types.ts` and
   the union is now derived from it (`typeof allPermissions[number]`), so there
   is one list and it cannot drift.

2. **Two tools were missing from the native allowlist because of a missing
   comma.** In `MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp`, `TEXT("sequence_inspect")` was
   followed by `TEXT("audio_inspect")` with no comma between them. Adjacent
   string literals concatenate, so the array held
   `"sequence_inspectaudio_inspect"` and both real names were absent;
   `AcceptCommand` would have refused both as unknown tools with nothing in the
   build to say why.

Neither would have been caught by `npm run verify`: the first lives in the
runtime that only executes inside the editor, the second in C++ nobody has
compiled. That is worth a check of its own, and it does not exist yet.

## Finding 0u: sequence_render shipped, asynchronously, and finding 0s was right about why

Lane Z, implemented, UNCOMPILED. `puerts_sequence_render_start`.

Finding 0s concluded that `sequence_render` could not ship as a synchronous
command and specified the shape it would need: a start that returns a job id, a
status poll, and an editor-side registry keyed by id that survives the client
disconnecting. That is what was built, on the general job API rather than as
three per-verb commands.

**Legacy MovieSceneCapture, not Movie Render Queue**, for the reason 0s gave:
MRQ exists in 4.27 at `Engine/Plugins/MovieScene/MovieRenderPipeline` and ships
`"EnabledByDefault": false`, so a command built on it would refuse on most
projects. The legacy path is the one the editor's own Render Movie button takes
in separate-process mode: serialize a `UAutomatedLevelSequenceCapture` to a
manifest, launch a second UE process with `-MovieSceneCaptureManifest`
(`MovieSceneCaptureDialogModule.cpp:678-744`).

Three decisions worth recording:

- **The manifest is produced from the real UObject**, not hand-written JSON. The
  child reconstructs it with `FJsonObjectConverter::JsonAttributesToUStruct`
  after resolving the class named in `Type`
  (`MovieSceneCaptureModule.cpp:104-160`), so a hand-rolled manifest would have
  to match property names this repository cannot check. Cost: two module
  dependencies, `MovieSceneCapture` (Runtime) and `MovieSceneTools` (Editor).
  This module is already editor-only.
- **One manifest per render**, under `Saved/MCPPuerTSBridge/render-<guid>.json`.
  The editor's dialog writes a single `Saved/MovieSceneCapture/Manifest.json`,
  which two concurrent renders would clobber.
- **The refusals are the work.** The second process reads the level and the
  sequence FROM DISK. An unsaved level, a never-saved level, or an unsaved
  sequence would render the previous version and exit zero, which a caller
  cannot tell from a good render. All three are refused by name, before anything
  is spawned, along with PIE and an output directory that resolves outside the
  project.

This is the one job in the bridge whose cancellation is immediate, and for a
boring reason: it is a separate process, so `FPlatformProcess::TerminateProc`
stops it. It is also the one job whose work outlives the editor, so a
`job_status` call after a restart says the record is gone AND that the render
may still be running, and names the output directory as the only handle left.

Not verified live. No editor has compiled this code.
## Finding 0v: widget_build re-saved an asset it had not changed

Found and fixed 2026-08-03 by lane X, live against BridgeInstallTest. The UI
slice's one red check: "3. a converged rerun wrote no new bytes to disk".

The structure hash was already unmoved by an identical rebuild, so the tree was
converging correctly. The FILE was not. UE regenerates a package GUID on every
save, so re-saving an unchanged asset changes its bytes unconditionally: there
is no such thing as an idempotent save. A caller told "nothing changed" then
finds a modified file, a source-control edit and a new checksum.

That makes "do not save when nothing changed" the only available form of
convergence for any builder in this catalog, not a nicety. It is worth stating
generally because the same check is written into the gameplay and materials
slices against different builders.

`RebuildWidgetFromJSON` has no no-op path and cannot get one cheaply: a widget
tree has no per-widget identity to merge against, so the spec is always the
whole tree and the rebuild always replaces it. Convergence is therefore measured
after the fact, in `MCPPuerTSBridgeWidget.cpp`: the canonical `DescribeWidget`
description of the tree the rebuild FOUND is compared with the one it LEFT.
Equal means the rebuild reproduced the same tree, so the file on disk is already
correct, nothing is saved, and the package's dirty flag is put back the way it
was found. `converged` is reported either way.

Live: `slice-ui` 20 passed, 0 failed, verdict PASS.

## Finding 0w: class_defaults_patch built its request JSON with printf and it did not parse

Found and fixed 2026-08-03 by lane X, live against BridgeInstallTest. The AI
slice's one red check, and the whole reason the AI domain could not be finished:

```
could not set 'AIControllerClass' on the class default object: value must be
valid JSON.
```

`PatchClassDefaultsJson` validated the value, exported it on a scratch copy of
the property, decided it was a real change, opened a transaction, snapshotted
the CDO, and then handed `SetObjectPropertyJson` a request string built as
`FString::Printf(TEXT("{\"value\":%s}"), *SerializedBareValue)`, where the bare
value came from `FJsonSerializer::Serialize(Value, TEXT(""), Writer)`.

Serializing a scalar at the ROOT of a writer is not the same operation as
writing an object field, and the receiving parser rejected the result. Every
class default write failed, on every property, for every caller. The command's
own rollback then worked correctly and reported an honest failure, which is why
this read as a tidy refusal rather than as damage.

Fixed by building a real `FJsonObject` and serializing it with the service's own
`SerializeJson`, the helper every other command in the file already uses. There
was no missing capability and no engine subtlety: there was a hand-built JSON
string next to a function that builds JSON.

The refusal now also quotes the value it sent. A write refusal that names
neither the value nor its encoding cannot be acted on without a debugger, and
this one could not: the message named the property and the parser's complaint
and nothing that would have located the defect.

Live: `slice-ai` 22 passed, 0 failed, verdict PASS, including the independent
read of `AIControllerClass` off the class default object through
`puerts_read_property` and a converged rerun that wrote nothing.

## Finding 0x: the graph connection vocabulary could not name a latent node's exec output

Found and fixed 2026-08-03 by lane X, live against BridgeInstallTest. This is
what took the gameplay slice from 0 of 4 to 16 of 17.

`docs/VERTICAL_SLICES.md` predicted this precisely and asked to be told which
way it fell: "If exactly that pair appears in `graph.unresolved_connections`,
the gap is the vocabulary, not the fixture." It did, and it was.

A latent function's output exec pin is `PN_Then` carrying a friendly name of
`Completed` (`K2Node_CallFunction.cpp:880`). The builder resolved a pin role by
`FindPin(FName(Role))` on the pin's real name only, so `wait.Completed` matched
nothing. That is every Delay, every latent async action, and every node in the
engine whose exec output the editor labels something other than its pin name:
the one connection those nodes exist to make was unexpressible.

Fixed by one shared `ResolveGraphPinByRole`, used by the builder AND by
`graph_patch`, which falls back to a direction-filtered match on
`PinFriendlyName` before giving up. `ResolvePatchPin` was a second copy of the
same four rules and is now a forward to the shared one, so a build and a patch
cannot drift on what a pin is called.

Two reporting defects found beside it and fixed in the same place:

- **"12 of 12 graph connection(s) could not be wired"** for ONE bad endpoint.
  A graph that is not whole is discarded entirely, which zeroes the
  connections-made count, and the message computed its numerator from that
  count. It now reports the number of connections that could not be RESOLVED,
  and only fires when there are any, so a graph discarded because a NODE was
  refused no longer gets a second error blaming eleven links that were fine.
- **A dropped connection named the role that failed and not the pins that
  exist.** It now lists the pins of that direction on that node, with each
  pin's display name beside its real name, which is exactly the information
  that turns `wait.Completed` into `wait.then` without opening the editor.

## Finding 0y: viewport_screenshot refused to take a picture unless it was told what to look at

Found and fixed 2026-08-03 by lane X. Three slices failed the same check with
`No requested actors were found for viewport capture.`

`CaptureViewportJson` gathered actors from the level, and gathered NONE when the
request named none and nothing in the level carried the `MCPPhysics` tag. It
then treated an empty gather as an error and returned before capturing
anything. So the AGENTS.md visual feedback loop, which calls
`viewport_screenshot` after every spatial operation with no arguments, could
only work in a level that happened to contain a physics fixture.

Naming actors means "frame these first". Naming none means "capture what the
viewport is looking at". Only a request that named actors and matched none is an
error now, and that refusal lists the names it was given and says they are
matched against both an actor's name and its label.

## Finding 0z: FIXED. blueprint_build no longer re-saves an unchanged asset because of one hidden pin

Diagnosed and fixed 2026-08-03 by lane X. The integrator re-ran the gameplay
slice against BridgeInstallTest after the compiled hidden-pin hash fix: 17
passed, 0 failed, with the converged rerun writing no new bytes to disk.

The red check is the gameplay slice's last one: "a converged rerun wrote no new
bytes to disk". Finding 0v established the general rule this sits under: UE
regenerates a package GUID on every save, so re-saving an unchanged asset always
changes its bytes, and "do not save" is the only form convergence can take.

`blueprint_build` now measures convergence the way `widget_build` does: the
asset's fingerprint before the build is compared with the one after, read
through `InspectBlueprintJson`, the same inspector a caller verifies with, as
`member_structure_hash_sha1 | graph structure_hash_sha1 | compile_status`. Equal
means the build reproduced what was there, so nothing is saved and the package's
dirty flag goes back the way it was found. Reported as `asset_unchanged`, with
both fingerprints.

**That was not enough on its own, and the reason is the finding.** Measured with
four probes against a live editor:

```
  inspect before build      bb9ac652...
  build, save:false         c7a3d997...
  inspect after build       c7a3d997...   (stable, +4s and +12s identical)
  puerts_save               ->
  inspect after save        bb9ac652...
```

The graph structure hash ALTERNATED across a save, forever. So the pre-build
fingerprint, read on a saved asset, never equalled the post-build one, no rerun
could ever be seen as converged, and every rerun saved again.

The whole difference, from a field-by-field diff of the two inspections, is one
pin on one node:

```
  after build   "default_value": "LatentInfo"
  after save    "default_value": "(Linkage=-1,UUID=-1,ExecutionFunction=\"\",CallbackTarget=None)"
```

The Delay node's hidden `LatentInfo` pin comes out of node creation holding the
string from the UFUNCTION's own latent metadata, and serialization rewrites it
to the struct's export text. Both are the same "no value"; neither is authored;
`autogenerated_default_value` stays `LatentInfo` in both.

Fixed at the hash: `structure_hash_sha1` now excludes HIDDEN pins, and
`structure_hash_basis` says so and says why. A hidden pin is compiler plumbing
that no build spec can set and no caller can address, and including it moved the
hash for a reason no caller caused and none could fix. This also matters beyond
one command: every slice's cold phase compares this hash across a restart, which
is exactly the save-and-load boundary that flipped it.

**Status: live-verified warm.** `Scripts/slice-gameplay.mjs` completed with 17
passed, 0 failed after the editor advertised session
`d946471b-4747-1ab7-8b70-638fab554d82`; `install:check` passed immediately
before and after the run. Cold evidence remains part of the wider slice
restart sweep.

## Finding 0aa: FIXED. Package existence did not prove an input was a level

Found during FP-5 integration on 2026-08-03 before the command was run live.

The lane draft validated level_path and template_path with
FPackageName::DoesPackageExist. That answers whether any package exists at the
name. It does not answer whether the package is a map, so a texture, Blueprint
or material package under /Game could pass preflight and reach LoadMap or
NewMapFromTemplate.

The distinguishing measurement is UE4.27 FileHelpers.cpp: UEditorLoadingAndSavingUtils::LoadMap
takes a filename and delegates directly to FEditorFileUtils::LoadMap. The
package type is not part of DoesPackageExist's contract. The command now
resolves the actual filename and requires
FPackageName::GetMapPackageExtension before any dirty check or level switch.
The same helper guards load, template creation and saving the current map.
Editor-free tests pin the check, and UHT, UBT and final linking pass. Live warm
and cold acceptance remains user-gated.
## Finding 0ab: FIXED. Sound Cue convergence originally ignored the special wave reference and cue properties

Found during FP-6 integration on 2026-08-03 before any live run.

The first comparator checked node ids, classes, ordered children and requested
node properties. It did not compare the builder's special `sound_wave` field,
and it did not compare requested properties on the `USoundCue` itself. A cue
with the requested topology but the wrong wave, volume or pitch could therefore
be reported as converged and skip the corrective write.

The distinguishing check was the reader, not the writer. `audio_inspect` had no
explicit wave field, while `audio_build` accepted `sound_wave` outside the
reflected property bag. The inspector now reports each Wave Player's resolved
`sound_wave` object path. The builder's convergence and post-write verification
compare that field and every requested cue property through the same inspector.
The focused contract, UHT, UE4.27 compile, library creation and DLL link pass.
Live warm and cold evidence remains user-gated.

## Finding 0ac: FIXED. World Settings' Game Mode panel was entirely unwritable, and two existing allowlist entries were already dead

Found 2026-08-05, user-directed: "master control over everything in World
Settings," pointing at the editor's World Settings > Game Mode panel where
every field (`GameMode Override`, `Default Pawn Class`, `HUD Class`, `Game
State Class`, `Player State Class`, `Spectator Class`) read `None`.

Reproduced live before touching anything: `puerts_set_property` on a
`WorldSettings` actor's `DefaultGameMode` (the reflected name behind the
"GameMode Override" display label, confirmed against
`Engine/Classes/GameFramework/WorldSettings.h:566` via `engine_source_search`)
refused with `"Writable property is not approved."`

Root cause read from `IsWritablePropertyAllowed()`
(`MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp:811`): it checks
`AllowedWritableProperties.Contains(Class->GetName() + "." + PropertyName)`
walking the object's class chain - always a `ClassName.PropertyName` pair,
never a bare name. BridgeInstallTest's own `Config/DefaultEngine.ini` had
`+AllowedWritableProperties=DefaultPawnClass` and `=PlayerControllerClass`
with no class prefix. Since `GConfig->GetArray` only falls back to the
compiled-in defaults when the ini array is completely empty
(`MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp:351`), and this project's ini was non-empty, both
entries were live but permanently unmatchable - dead config nobody had
noticed because nothing had tried to use them since whatever session added
them.

Fixed at both layers: the compiled-in default list in
`MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp` gained
`WorldSettings.DefaultGameMode` and `GameModeBase.{DefaultPawnClass,
PlayerControllerClass, HUDClass, GameStateClass, PlayerStateClass,
SpectatorClass}` (ships for every project going forward), and
BridgeInstallTest's local ini was corrected to the qualified form so it
benefits immediately without depending on the ini being cleared. Verified live
after rebuild and editor restart: the exact `WorldSettings.DefaultGameMode`
write that was refused before now succeeds and reads back correctly, and
`WorldSettings.DefaultGameMode` was set to a real project GameMode class as
part of the same session's third-person character work.

`World`, `Physics`, `Lightmass`, `Broadphase` and `VR` sections of World
Settings remain unwidened - "master control over everything" is a bigger,
deliberate follow-up, not attempted this session per the one-capability-per-
session rule. This finding covers the Game Mode panel specifically, which is
what blocked the actual task.

## Finding 0ad: class_defaults_patch cannot reach a component's properties, only the actor class's own

Found 2026-08-05, same session, immediately after finding 0ac made
`SkeletalMeshComponent.SkeletalMesh` and `.AnimClass` writable-allowlist
entries. Setting a Character Blueprint's mesh through
`puerts_class_defaults_patch` still could not work, and reading
`PatchClassDefaultsJson` (`MCPPuerTSBridgeClassDefaults.cpp:182`) shows why
before ever calling it: `Op.Property = FindFProperty<FProperty>(CDO->GetClass(),
*Op.Name)` resolves the property name only against the CDO's own class chain.
A property that lives on a *component* subobject (`Mesh`/`CharacterMesh0`,
`CollisionCylinder`, any SCS node) is never on that chain - `FindFProperty`
returns null and the whole op is refused as "not a reflected property," never
reaching the allowlist check at all. Widening the allowlist for a component
class name (as 0ac did) makes the property reachable through
`puerts_set_property` on a placed actor INSTANCE's component object path
(proven working), but not through `class_defaults_patch` on a Blueprint's
CDO - there is no subobject-path resolution in that command at all.

Practical effect: there is currently no bridge-only way to set a class-default
mesh/material/anything-on-a-component for a Blueprint. The standard UE4
fallback - `ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder`/`FClassFinder` in the native
C++ base class's constructor - is what `ABridgeThirdPersonCharacter` uses
instead, and it is arguably the more idiomatic answer anyway, not just a
workaround. Not fixed: extending `class_defaults_patch` to resolve dotted
component paths is real new scope (component lookup by name, then property
lookup on the subobject's class, then the same allowlist check qualified by
the component's class rather than the actor's) - a distinct future capability,
not attempted this session.

## Finding 0ae: puerts_spawn_actor's class allowlist excludes a project's own native (non-Blueprint) classes

Found 2026-08-05, same session. `puerts_spawn_actor` with
`class_path=/Script/BridgeInstallTest.BridgeThirdPersonCharacter` (a plain
native `ACharacter` subclass in the target project's own game module, not a
Blueprint) refused: `"Actor classes are limited to /Game, /Script/Engine,
CineCameraActor, and LevelSequenceActor."` A project's own compiled C++
gameplay classes are not `/Script/Engine` and are not under `/Game`, so they
cannot be placed directly.

This turned out to match standard UE4 practice rather than fight it: Epic's
own convention is to place a thin Blueprint wrapper of a native class in a
level, never the raw native class, precisely so editor tooling (here, the
bridge's spawn allowlist) has a `/Game` asset to address. The fix used this
session was exactly that - `puerts_blueprint_build` with `parent_class:
"/Script/BridgeInstallTest.BridgeThirdPersonCharacter"` and no components or
graph, a few lines, then `puerts_spawn_actor` on the generated
`_C` class path, which the allowlist already permits. Recorded as a finding
rather than left silent because the refusal message doesn't say this is the
expected shape - a caller hitting it for the first time has no reason to guess
"wrap it in an empty Blueprint" is the sanctioned fix rather than a dead end.

## Finding 0af: FIXED. spawn_actor's class allowlist blocked NavMeshBoundsVolume, which is also NotBlueprintable so 0ae's own fix doesn't apply to it

Found 2026-08-05, building an AI-controlled chaser (Assailant): no level had a
NavMeshBoundsVolume, so no AI could path anywhere. `puerts_spawn_actor` with
`class_path=/Script/NavigationSystem.NavMeshBoundsVolume` refused with the
same "/Game, /Script/Engine, CineCameraActor, LevelSequenceActor" allowlist
finding 0ae describes. That finding's own fix - wrap the class in an empty
`/Game` Blueprint - does NOT apply here: `puerts_blueprint_build` refused with
"Unreal refuses Blueprints of class ...NavMeshBoundsVolume" (`AVolume` and
several of its subclasses are marked `NotBlueprintable` in engine source, a
real engine restriction, not a bridge one). With no Blueprint route and the
class outside every allowed prefix, there was no way to make a level
navigable through this bridge at all - a hard blocker for every future AI
task, not just this one.

The allowlist turned out to be enforced TWICE, independently, with near-
identical wording: once in `puerts-runtime/src/registry.ts`'s `spawnActor`
(a plain TS prefix check, no C++ involved) and again natively in
`UMCPPuerTSBridgeService::SpawnActorJson`
(`MCPPuerTSBridgeService.cpp:1380`). Fixing only one produces a different,
confusing refusal from the other layer ("Actor spawn requires an approved
class path and active transaction" from native, after the TS layer had
already been widened) - worth knowing before assuming one fix covers a spawn
allowlist change. Both are now widened by exactly one class,
`/Script/NavigationSystem.NavMeshBoundsVolume`, not the whole module: verified
live, spawned into `L_BridgeThirdPerson`, and `puerts_nav_build wait:true`
produced a real `RecastNavMesh-Default`.

## Finding 0ag: three separate tools share one blind spot - Blueprint-level component tooling cannot see or touch a component a native C++ parent class created

Found across this session building `ABridgeThirdPersonCharacter` and then
`AAssailantAIController`/`AAssailantCharacter`, in three independent tools:

1. `puerts_class_defaults_patch` (finding 0ad): `FindFProperty<FProperty>`
   only walks the CDO's own class chain, never a subobject's.
2. `puerts_blueprint_build`'s `components` array: adding a component named
   the same as one already inherited from C++ does not attach to or
   configure it; the native one stays whatever the constructor set.
3. `puerts_ai_perception_build`: pointed at `AAssailantAIController` (which
   creates its own `UAIPerceptionComponent` named "AIPerception" in its
   constructor), it could not find that component, instead ran
   `AddComponentToBlueprint` and created a SECOND, differently-named one
   ("AIPerception1"), then failed to give it a template
   ("Component 'AIPerception' was added but has no AIPerceptionComponent
   template") and rolled back the transaction - but the stray SCS component
   survived the rollback. `puerts_ai_controller_inspect` and
   `puerts_anim_blend_space_inspect`'s siblings already say this plainly in
   their own docstrings ("Only components this Blueprint declares in its
   SimpleConstructionScript are visible... which this reader does not walk"),
   but the write-side tools do not warn before acting, and in perception's
   case the failure left real litter: `puerts_delete_asset` with `force:true`
   was needed to clean up the half-built Blueprint (the plain `confirm:true`
   delete refused with "may still have an in-memory reference").

The working pattern, used for all three cases this session: give the native
C++ base class everything a Blueprint-level tool cannot reach - mesh,
AnimClass, AIPerceptionComponent plus its sense config, `AIControllerClass` -
via the constructor (`ConstructorHelpers`, `CreateDefaultSubobject`,
`ConfigureSense`), and let the Blueprint wrapper stay a thin, empty
placement shim. Not a workaround so much as the correct division of labor
once you know where the line is: the bridge's Blueprint tools own
Blueprint-declared state; a native class's own constructor is the only
reliable way to configure what it declares itself.

Not fixed: extending `class_defaults_patch` and `ai_perception_build` to
resolve a native-declared component by name (walk the class's default
subobjects, not just the SCS) is real, shared new scope across at least two
tools - a distinct future capability, not attempted this session.

## Finding 0ah: behavior_tree_build fails to save when pointed at a separately pre-built blackboard_path

Found 2026-08-05. `puerts_blackboard_build` created `BB_Assailant` (reported
`created: true, saved: true`). Pointing `puerts_behavior_tree_build` at it via
`blackboard_path` built the tree graph successfully (5 nodes, log confirms
"[BTBuilder] built BT 'BT_Assailant'") but then failed to SAVE: "Graph is
linked to private object(s) in an external package. External Object(s):
/Game/MCPGenerated/BB_Assailant" - `UPackage::Save` itself refused, not the
bridge's own verification. The build was correctly rolled back (asset
removed, `rollback_succeeded: true`).

Not root-caused to the exact private-object flag (likely something about how
a pre-existing blackboard asset's internal object is referenced versus one
`behavior_tree_build` creates itself). Workaround, not a fix: let
`behavior_tree_build` create its own blackboard (omit `blackboard_path`, pass
`keys` directly) - this is the tool's default, better-trodden path per its
own description, and it saved cleanly with the identical key set. Sharing one
blackboard across several trees via a pre-built `blackboard_path` - a use
case the tool's own schema explicitly documents ("Point several trees at one
path to share a blackboard") - is confirmed broken and not investigated
further this session.

## Finding 0ai: FIXED. NavMeshBoundsVolume (and every other spawned Volume) had zero geometry - ABrush::Brush is never constructed by a plain SpawnActor

Found 2026-08-05, same session as 0af, while actually trying to use the
navmesh that finding fixed the allowlist for. A spawned NavMeshBoundsVolume
reported correct transform and PolyFlags but `bounds: {extent: {0,0,0}}` no
matter what `scale` was requested, and `puerts_nav_build` produced a
`RecastNavMesh-Default` with zero navigable area - a technically-successful
build over nothing, which is worse than a refusal because nothing in the
response said so.

Root-caused by reading engine source directly rather than guessing:
`ABrush::Brush` (`Engine/Brush.h:106`, `UPROPERTY(Instanced)`) is the `UModel`
holding the actual BSP polygon data, and `ABrush::ABrush()`
(`Brush.cpp:35-50`) constructs `BrushComponent` but never touches `Brush` -
it stays null forever unless something else sets it. The confirming detail:
`UEditorBrushBuilder::EndBrush` (`EditorBrushBuilder.cpp:49-80`, what every
brush builder's `Build()` call ends with) opens with
`UModel* Brush = BuilderBrush->Brush; if (Brush == nullptr) { return true; }`
- silently reports SUCCESS and writes zero polygons when the Model doesn't
exist yet. A first fix attempt (build a `UCubeBuilder` cube straight after
`SpawnActor`) hit exactly this silent no-op and looked like it had worked.

The editor's own "Place Actors" volume placement never hits this because
it constructs the `UModel` as part of placement, before any builder runs;
`GEditor->AddActor` (what `SpawnActorJson` uses for every actor class) has no
equivalent step for Brush-derived actors specifically. Fixed by explicitly
constructing `Brush->Brush = NewObject<UModel>(...)` and calling
`Brush->Brush->Initialize(Brush, true)` before handing it to `UCubeBuilder`,
in `SpawnActorJson` itself, gated on `Cast<ABrush>(Actor)` succeeding - so
every future Volume placed through this bridge gets real geometry by
default, not just NavMeshBoundsVolume. Verified live: a spawned volume's
registered nav bounds went from `{0,0,0}` extent to `{2000,2000,500}` (a real
box matching the requested scale), `puerts_nav_build` produced a
correspondingly-sized navmesh, and an Assailant AIController's `MoveTo` then
produced real non-zero pursuit velocity toward the player in PIE where it had
previously done nothing.

## Finding 0aj: puerts_scene_batch's own convergence check misreads a component-property-only write as a no-op and rolls it back, even though the write succeeded

Found 2026-08-05, building level geometry. `upsert_actor` with only a
`components: {StaticMeshComponent0: {StaticMesh: "..."}}} ` override (no
location/rotation/scale/label change) on an existing StaticMeshActor always
fails with "operation reported as applied, but the structure hash is
unchanged" and rolls back - even though the identical write through
`puerts_set_property` on the same object path succeeds immediately and
sticks.

The cause is legible from the tool's own documented contract, once the two
halves are put next to each other: `puerts_scene_inspect`'s
`structure_hash_basis` explicitly excludes property values by design ("Bounds
and reflected property values are deliberately excluded... property values
are verified per operation rather than folded into one number") - a
`StaticMesh` assignment can never move that hash, structurally correctly.
But `scene_batch`'s own success check for an already-structurally-satisfied
operation appears to use "did the structure hash change" as its proxy for
"did anything happen," which is exactly the comparison its sibling inspector
says is the wrong one for a property-only change. Confirmed by isolating the
write: identical `StaticMesh` value, same object, `set_property` alone
succeeds and reads back correctly; the same write wrapped in a `scene_batch`
`upsert_actor` op reports the mismatch and undoes itself.

Workaround used this session, not a fix: spawn or move actors structurally
through `scene_batch`/`puerts_spawn_actor` (those fields DO move the hash and
verify correctly), then set component properties like `StaticMesh`
individually through `puerts_set_property`. Costs one extra round trip per
actor instead of the single batched call the tool exists to provide, which
defeats a real part of its purpose for level-dressing work (placing many
static meshes is exactly scene_batch's stated use case). Not fixed: the
native comparison needs to check requested property values against
independently-read actual values (the way `puerts_audio_build` and
`puerts_anim_blend_space_build` verify against their own inspectors) rather
than relying on the structure hash for a case the hash was never meant to
cover.

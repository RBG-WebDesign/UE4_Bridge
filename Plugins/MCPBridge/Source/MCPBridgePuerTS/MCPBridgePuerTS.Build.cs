        // UWidgetTree back out of the UWidgetBlueprint to answer with the
        // hierarchy that actually landed. The tree construction itself stays
        // in MCPBridgeGraphBuilder.
        // AIModule and GameplayTasks are for behavior_tree_build only: the
        // UBehaviorTree and UBlackboardData types it creates live there.

        // reports whether a file is opened for add or checked out, so a caller
        // can see that a failure performed no source-control operation. It
        // never adds, checks out, or reverts.
        // BlueprintGraph is for UK2Node_Variable only: remove_unlisted has to find
        // the graph nodes that read or write a variable before it may remove it.
        // AnimGraph is for anim_blueprint_inspect only: UAnimGraphNode_StateMachineBase,
        // UAnimStateNode and UAnimStateTransitionNode are editor types in that
        // module, and the state machine structure cannot be read without them.

        // them reading UNavigationSystemV1, ANavigationData, ANavMeshBoundsVolume
        // and ANavModifierVolume. AIModule already covers blackboard,
        // Environment Query and AIPerception types.
        // MaterialEditor is for material_inspect, material_instance_build and
        // material_build: UMaterialEditingLibrary is the only 4.27 API that reads
        // and writes material instance parameters by plain FName, and it is
        // editor-only, which this module already is.
        // RenderCore and RHI are for the material compile report:
        // GMaxRHIFeatureLevel selects the FMaterialResource whose compile errors
        // are reported instead of assumed.
        // InputCore is for input_mapping_info and input_mapping_patch: an input
        // mapping is identified by its FKey, which is that module's type.
        // MCPBridgePIEAgent is a dependency for the same reason

        // lines each reading as though it were the whole list. Consolidated at
        // integration; add to this list rather than beside it.

        // 4.27 API that moves an asset AND leaves a UObjectRedirector behind, so
        // existing references keep resolving. Moving the package file instead
        // would break every referencer silently, and a .umap carries its package
        // path in its own header, so a file move is not even correct for maps.

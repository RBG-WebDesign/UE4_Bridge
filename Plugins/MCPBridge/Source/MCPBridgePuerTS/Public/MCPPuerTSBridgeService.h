        MUTATING and deliberately NOT transactional. Navigation data is derived
        data, generated by background tasks into a generator that the
        transaction buffer does not record, and the editor's own Build Paths
        agrees: FEditorBuildUtils::EditorBuild calls

        (EditorBuildUtils.cpp:395) before triggering it, discarding the undo
        stack outright. Wrapping this in a transaction would produce an undo
        entry that restores nothing. It is absent from IsToolMutating for that
        reason, and it is still a write: it regenerates navmesh tiles, and with
        wait it can spawn a missing RecastNavMesh actor.

        Every precondition is checked and refused by name BEFORE anything runs,

        (NavigationSystem.cpp:3297-3302) and a command that called it blind
        would report success over a level that still has no navmesh.

        Two shapes, and the difference is honesty about time.
        wait: false, the default, calls the public non-blocking
        ANavigationData::RebuildAll on every registered nav data and answers
        status "building"; poll puerts_nav_inspect until remaining_build_tasks
        is zero. wait: true calls FNavigationSystem::Build, which is what the
        editor does (EditorBuildUtils.cpp:868) and which BLOCKS until every nav
        data reports EnsureBuildCompletion (NavigationSystem.cpp:3329-3335), so
        on a large level it can outlast the named pipe deadline while the build
        keeps running in the editor. Only the blocking path spawns a missing
        RecastNavMesh, so wait: false refuses a level that has bounds volumes
        and no nav data actor rather than pretending to build one.

        MarkPackageDirty; and the package's dirty flag is reported before and
        after the read.

        Binding identity is OBSERVED (identity_kind = "observed"): the id is the
        FGuid UMovieScene already stores, which survives a rename and a restart.

        Frames are reported in DISPLAY-RATE frames, with the raw tick values
        beside them, so a caller never has to know that UE4.27 stores key times
        at 60000 ticks per second to compare a read against a spec.

        Whether a possessable resolves to a live actor is reported under
        "resolution", which is deliberately OUTSIDE the hashed set: resolution
        depends on which level the editor has open, and a hash that moved when
